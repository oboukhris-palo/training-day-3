  So that I can access the application securely

Background:
  Given the application is running
  And the database is accessible
  And the email service is configured

Scenario: Successful registration with valid credentials
  Given I am on the registration page
  And no account exists with email "newuser@example.com"
  When I enter email "newuser@example.com"
  And I enter password "SecurePass123!"
  And I confirm password "SecurePass123!"
  And I accept the terms and conditions
  And I click "Create Account"
  Then I should see "Account created successfully"
  And I should see "Please check your email to verify your account"
  And I should receive an email at "newuser@example.com" within 60 seconds
  And the email should contain a verification link valid for 24 hours
  And the email subject should be "Verify your {PROJECT_NAME} account"
  And my account status in the database should be "PENDING_VERIFICATION"

Scenario: Registration with existing email
  Given I am on the registration page
  And an account already exists with email "existing@example.com"
  When I enter email "existing@example.com"
  And I enter password "SecurePass123!"
  And I confirm password "SecurePass123!"
  And I click "Create Account"
  Then I should see "An account with this email already exists"
  And I should see a link to "Log in to your account"
  And I should see a link to "Forgot password?"
  And no new account should be created in the database

Scenario: Registration with weak password
  Given I am on the registration page
  When I enter email "newuser@example.com"
  And I enter password "weak"
  And I confirm password "weak"
  Then I should see "Password must be at least 8 characters"
  And I should see "Password must contain uppercase, lowercase, and numbers"
  And the "Create Account" button should be disabled
  And no account should be created

Scenario Outline: Password validation rules
  Given I am on the registration page
  When I enter email "test@example.com"
  And I enter password "<password>"
  And I confirm password "<password>"
  Then I should see "<error_message>"
  And the "Create Account" button should be <button_state>

  Examples:
    | password      | error_message                              | button_state |
    | short         | Password must be at least 8 characters     | disabled     |

Scenario: Password and confirmation mismatch
  Given I am on the registration page
  When I enter email "newuser@example.com"
  And I enter password "SecurePass123!"
  And I confirm password "DifferentPass123!"
  Then I should see "Passwords do not match"
  And the "Create Account" button should be disabled

Scenario: Registration rate limiting
  Given I am on the registration page
  And I have attempted to register 5 times in the last hour from IP "192.168.1.100"
  When I attempt to register again
  Then I should see "Too many registration attempts. Please try again in 1 hour."
  And I should receive HTTP status code 429 (Too Many Requests)
  And no account should be created

Scenario: Email service unavailable
  Given I am on the registration page
  And the email service is unavailable
  When I enter valid registration details
  And I click "Create Account"
  Then I should see "Account created, but verification email failed to send"
  And I should see a button "Resend verification email"
  And my account should be created in the database with status "PENDING_VERIFICATION"
```

  And the verification token should be marked as "USED"

Scenario: Verification with expired token
  Given I registered with "user@example.com" 25 hours ago
  And I received a verification email with token "expired123"
  And the verification token expired 1 hour ago
  When I click the verification link
  Then I should see "Verification link has expired"
  And I should see "This link was valid for 24 hours"
  And I should see a button "Resend verification email"
  And my account status should still be "PENDING_VERIFICATION"

Scenario: Resend verification email
  Given I registered with "user@example.com"
  And my email is not verified
  And I am on the "Email Verification" page

**Your Task:**
Execute BDD scenarios in full test environment and report results:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Verify test environment running
   - Verify database seeded with test data
   - Verify external services available (or mocked)
   - Clear any cached state from previous runs

2. **Execute BDD Scenarios**
   - Run all scenarios for this story
   - Capture: Pass/Fail, execution time, screenshots (if applicable)
   - For failures: Capture error messages, stack traces, screenshots

3. **Analyze Results**
   - Happy path scenarios passing?
   - Edge cases handled correctly?
   - Error scenarios validated?
   - Performance acceptable? (response times)

4. **Report to PO**
   - Summary: X of Y scenarios passing
   - Details on failures (if any)
   - Recommendation: ACCEPT / REVISE / REJECT

## Failure Analysis

### Critical Failures (Block Acceptance)
1. **Scenario 3**: Password validation not enforced
   - **Severity**: HIGH
   - **Impact**: Users can create accounts with weak passwords (security risk)
   - **Recommendation**: REVISE - Fix frontend validation before acceptance

### Minor Issues (Can be accepted with caveats)
None identified

---

## Performance Assessment

| Scenario | Execution Time | NFR Target | Status |
|----------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Registration success | 3.2s | <5s | ✅ PASS |
| Registration existing email | 1.8s | <5s | ✅ PASS |

**Overall Performance**: ✅ Acceptable

---

## Non-Functional Validation

### Security
- ✅ Password hashing verified (bcrypt)
- ✅ Email verification token secure (UUID)
- ✅ Rate limiting functional (5 attempts/hour)
- ⚠️ Weak password accepted (Frontend validation missing)

### Usability
- ✅ Error messages clear and actionable
- ✅ Success messages visible
- ✅ Redirect after registration works

### Accessibility
- ✅ Form fields have proper labels
- ✅ Error messages announced to screen readers
- ✅ Keyboard navigation works

---

## Recommendation

**Decision**: ⚠️ REVISE (1 critical issue)

**Rationale**:
- 6 of 7 scenarios passing (86%)
- 1 critical security issue: weak password validation not enforced
- All functional requirements working except password complexity
- Performance and accessibility acceptable

**Required Changes**:
1. **Fix Frontend Password Validation** (Estimated: 2 hours)
   - Add real-time validation for password complexity
   - Disable "Create Account" button until all criteria met
   - Revalidate Scenario 3 after fix

**Estimated Rework Time**: 3 hours (fix + retest)

**Next BDD Validation**: After fix deployed to test environment
