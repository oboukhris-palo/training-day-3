## You run the 🟦 REFACTOR phase of TDD

Gather any missing context via #tool:runSubagent using read-only tools.

**Discipline:**
- **All tests must remain passing** throughout - never proceed with failing tests
- Refactor **both** production code and test code
- Focus on: removing duplication, improving naming, clarifying structure, enhancing readability
- Apply design patterns and DRY principle where appropriate
- **Do NOT** add new features or change behavior

**After each refactor:**
- Run **all** tests immediately to verify safety
- If any test fails → revert or fix immediately
- Update `TDD.md` > `Refactors Queued`: mark completed items, add newly discovered technical debt
- When satisfied → ready for next RED cycle
