## Touchpoint Inventory

| Touchpoint | Channel | Purpose | Owner |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------|
| Landing Page | Web | Awareness, conversion | Marketing + UX |
| Registration | Web/Mobile | Onboarding | Dev + UX |
| Dashboard | Web/Mobile | Regular usage | Dev + UX |
| Email Notifications | Email | Engagement, retention | Dev + Marketing |

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: {DATE}  
**Created By**: {UX_NAME}  
**Approved By**: {PO_NAME}, {BA_NAME}
```

**Quality Gates**:
- ✓ All primary personas have journey maps
- ✓ Both AS-IS and TO-BE journeys documented
- ✓ 5 stages covered (Awareness → Retention)
- ✓ Emotions quantified (0-10 scale)
- ✓ Pain points specific with time/cost impact
- ✓ Opportunities mapped to requirements

## 4. Component Inventory

| Component | Type | States | Usage |
|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Button | Primary, Secondary, Danger | Default, Hover, Active, Disabled | CTAs, form submissions |
| Input | Text, Email, Password | Default, Focus, Valid, Invalid | Forms |
| Card | Info, Interactive | Default, Hover, Selected | Dashboard stats, task list |
| Modal | Confirmation, Form, Info | Open, Closed | Dialogs, tutorials |
| Table | Data Grid | Default, Sortable, Paginated | Task history |
| Progress Bar | Linear | Static, Animated | File upload, processing |
| Toast | Success, Error, Warning, Info | Visible (5s), Dismissed | Notifications |

---

## 5. Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Inline Validation
- **Trigger**: Field blur (user tabs away)
- **Behavior**: Show error message below field, red border
- **Accessibility**: Error announced to screen readers

### Pattern 2: Optimistic Updates
- **Trigger**: User action (e.g., mark task complete)
- **Behavior**: UI updates immediately, show spinner, rollback if fails
- **Feedback**: Toast notification on success/failure

### Pattern 3: Lazy Loading
- **Trigger**: User scrolls near bottom of list
- **Behavior**: Load next 20 items, show skeleton loaders
- **Performance**: Reduces initial page load time

---

## 6. Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width | Layout |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Mobile | <768px | 1 column, bottom nav |
| Tablet | 768-1024px | 2 columns, side nav |
| Desktop | >1024px | 3 columns, expanded nav |

---

## 7. Accessibility Checklist

- ✅ Color contrast ≥4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- ✅ All interactive elements keyboard-accessible
- ✅ Focus indicators visible
- ✅ Screen reader tested (NVDA, JAWS)
- ✅ ARIA labels on icon buttons
- ✅ Skip to main content link
- ✅ Form error messages associated with fields
- ✅ Alt text on all images

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: {DATE}  
**Created By**: {UX_NAME}  
**Approved By**: {PO_NAME}, {ARCHITECT_NAME}
```

**Quality Gates**:
- ✓ All critical screens wireframed (≥8 screens)
- ✓ Both desktop and mobile wireframes
- ✓ User flows documented with Mermaid diagrams
- ✓ Interactions annotated (click, hover, validation)
- ✓ Responsive breakpoints defined
- ✓ Accessibility checklist complete

**Confidence Threshold**: 85%

⚠️ **ESCALATE TO ARCHITECT IF**:
- Technical constraints prevent desired UX
- Real-time features require complex infrastructure
- Mobile app requirements beyond responsive web
- Performance concerns (e.g., large data visualization)

**After Wireframes Created**:
Hand off to Architect: "Wireframes approved. Design technical architecture to support these screens and user flows."
```

## 8. Implementation Guide

### Setup Design Tokens (CSS Variables)
```css
/* tokens.css */
:root {
  /* Copy all design tokens here */
}
```

### Import Fonts
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Component Library
- **React**: Use Storybook for component development
- **Angular**: Angular Material with custom theming
- **Vue**: Vuetify or custom components

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: {DATE}  
**Created By**: {UX_NAME}  
**Approved By**: {PO_NAME}, {DEV_LEAD_NAME}
```

**Quality Gates**:
- ✓ All design tokens defined (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, radius)
- ✓ All components from blueprints.md have specifications
- ✓ Component states documented (default, hover, active, disabled, error)
- ✓ Code examples provided for {FRAMEWORK}
- ✓ Color contrast meets WCAG AA (≥4.5:1)
- ✓ Accessibility checklist complete
- ✓ Figma link included (if applicable)
- ✓ Responsive breakpoints defined

**Confidence Threshold**: 90%

⚠️ **ESCALATE TO DEV-LEAD IF**:
- Component complexity exceeds framework capabilities
- Animation requirements need custom JS (not CSS)
- Dark mode support requires significant refactoring
- Third-party component library conflicts with design system

**After Design System Created**:
Hand off to Dev-Lead: "Design system complete with {COUNT} components. Ready for frontend implementation. Reference /docs/design/design-systems.md for all design tokens and component specs."
```

### Prerequisites
1. Active Figma account with document access
2. Figma MCP connection established in the project environment

### Key Workflows
**Connecting to Figma:**
```
1. Call `mcp_talktofigma_join_channel` with the channel name
2. Use `mcp_talktofigma_get_document_info` to inspect current document
3. Use `mcp_talktofigma_read_my_design` to analyze selected elements
```

**Creating UI Components:**
```
1. Use `mcp_talktofigma_create_frame` to create frames with auto-layout
2. Use `activate_creation_tools` to add rectangles, text, and component instances
3. Use `activate_auto_layout_tools` to configure responsive behavior
4. Use `mcp_talktofigma_set_item_spacing` to control element spacing
```

**Managing Design Systems:**
```
1. Retrieve styles: `mcp_talktofigma_get_styles`
2. Retrieve components: `mcp_talktofigma_get_local_components`
3. Apply overrides to instances using `activate_instance_override_tools`
4. Maintain consistency across component instances
```

**Exporting & Documentation:**
```
1. Export designs: `mcp_talktofigma_export_node_as_image` (PNG/JPG/SVG/PDF)
