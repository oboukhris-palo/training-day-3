# Start PDLC Workflow - Interactive Launcher

**Purpose**: Launch the complete Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC) workflow from Stage 1 through Stage 8

**Workflow Reference**: [.github/workflows/documents.workflows.md](/.github/workflows/documents.workflows.md)

**Orchestrator Agent**: [.github/agents/orchestrator.agent.md](/.github/agents/orchestrator.agent.md)

---

## Usage

Copy and paste this prompt to GitHub Copilot Chat to start the PDLC workflow:

```
@orchestrator Start new PDLC workflow for [PROJECT_NAME]

Project Type: [web-application / mobile-app / api-service / desktop-app / other]
Project Description: [Brief description of what the project will do]
Initial Requirements: [High-level goals and objectives]

Orchestrate me through the complete PDLC workflow (8 stages) with the following approach:
1. Go step-by-step interactively
2. Present 3 options with pros/cons for all critical decisions (architecture, technology stack, design patterns)
3. Invoke appropriate agents at each stage with proper subagentType
4. Maintain todo list tracking all stages and progress
5. Enforce quality gates and approval processes
6. Ensure all documents trace back to requirements.md
7. Pause at decision gates for my input before proceeding

Start with Stage 1: Requirements Gathering
- Invoke PM Agent (pm-kickoff) for project charter
- Invoke PO Agent (po-requirements-analysis) for requirements.md
- Invoke Architect Agent (architect-requirements-review) for feasibility

Let's begin!
```

## Progress Tracking

The Orchestrator maintains a todo list throughout the workflow:

```yaml
pdlc_progress:
  current_stage: 3
  current_stage_name: "Design & Architecture"
  
  stages:
    - stage: 1
      name: "Requirements Gathering"
      status: "completed"
      approval_date: "2025-12-20"
      
    - stage: 2
      name: "Analysis & Business Justification"
      status: "completed"
      approval_date: "2025-12-21"
      
    - stage: 3
      name: "Design & Architecture"
      status: "in-progress"
      tasks:
        - task: "Create journey-maps.md"
          agent: "ux-journey-maps"
          status: "completed"
          
        - task: "Create architecture-design.md"
          agent: "architect-design"
          status: "in-progress"
          
        - task: "Architecture decision gate"
          status: "blocked"
          waiting_for: "user-decision"
          
    - stage: 4
      name: "Development Planning"
      status: "not-started"
      
    # ... stages 5-8
    
  quality_gates_passed: 4
  quality_gates_pending: 1
  documents_generated: 5
  documents_approved: 4
```

## Key Orchestration Principles

1. **Sequential Progression**: Complete each stage fully before moving to next
2. **Interactive Decision Gates**: Pause for user decisions at critical points (architecture, technology, priorities)
3. **3 Options Rule**: Always present 3 options with pros/cons for major decisions
4. **Traceability**: All documents trace back to requirements.md
5. **Quality Gates**: Enforce approval processes before stage progression
6. **Agent Specialization**: Invoke correct agent with proper subagentType
7. **Transparency**: Maintain updated todo list showing real-time progress
8. **Document Standards**: Follow templates and comply with documentation.instructions.md

Do you approve this charter? [Yes / No / Request Changes]"

USER: "Yes, approved"

ORCHESTRATOR:
"Great! Moving to requirements analysis...

[Invoking PO Agent for requirements.md]"

[PO Agent creates requirements.md]

"requirements.md created with:
- 15 functional requirements
- 8 non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- 3 user roles (Team Member, Team Lead, Admin)
- Success metrics and KPIs

[Invoking Architect Agent for feasibility review]"

[Architect reviews and provides feasibility assessment]

"Feasibility Assessment:
✓ Technical feasibility: HIGH
✓ Complexity: MEDIUM
⚠ Key risks: Real-time collaboration (WebSocket complexity)
✓ Timeline achievable: YES

**Quality Gate 1.2: Requirements Baseline Approval**
Do you approve requirements.md as baseline? [Yes / No / Request Changes]"

USER: "Yes, approved"

ORCHESTRATOR:
"Excellent! Stage 1 complete. ✓

Moving to Stage 2: Analysis & Business Justification...

[Invoking BA Agent for personas]"

[Continue orchestrating through all stages...]
