## 📋 Agent Logging Requirements (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ UNBREAKABLE RULE: ALL agent interactions during assessment phase MUST be logged.**

### Logging Locations for Assessment Phase

**All agents working in assessment phase log to**: `/logs/00-assessment/agent-{name}-YYYYMMDD.md`

### Agents Required to Log

| Agent | Primary Activities | Log Path |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| **orchestrator** | Workflow coordination, decision gates | `/logs/00-assessment/agent-orchestrator-YYYYMMDD.md` |
| **ba** | Input analysis, maturity assessment | `/logs/00-assessment/agent-ba-YYYYMMDD.md` |
| **architect** | Technical inventory, architecture analysis | `/logs/00-assessment/agent-architect-YYYYMMDD.md` |
| **ai-engineering** | AI capability assessment, model recommendations | `/logs/00-assessment/agent-ai-engineering-YYYYMMDD.md` |
| **pm** | Prerequisites tracking, timeline planning | `/logs/00-assessment/agent-pm-YYYYMMDD.md` |

### Mandatory Logging Points

**Phase 1-2: Context Discovery**
- Log input inventory results
- Log prerequisites generation
- Log baseline assessment findings

**Phase 3: Prerequisites Fulfillment**
- Log access request tracking
- Log fulfillment status updates
- Log blockers and escalations

**Phase 4-5: Deep Assessment**
- Log multi-dimensional scoring
- Log stakeholder interview findings
- Log confidence ratings and evidence

**Phase 6: Strategic Planning**
- Log readiness report generation
- Log roadmap creation
- Log handoff artifact preparation

### Log Entry Template

```markdown
## {TIMESTAMP} | Action: {DESCRIPTION} | Status: {success|failure|partial|blocked}

### Context
- **Phase**: ASSESSMENT
- **Stage**: {1|2|3|4}
- **Dimension**: {dimension_name} (if applicable)

### Action Details
- **Action Type**: {read|write|analyze|coordinate}

### Handoff
- **Next Step**: {awaiting|handoff_to_agent|continue|complete}
- **Next Agent**: {agent_name}
- **Handoff Artifact**: {path}
- **Instructions**: {guidance}

---
```

### Validation Enforcement

**Orchestrator validates logs before**:
- Each phase transition (1→2, 2→3, etc.)
- Prerequisites fulfillment sign-off
- Readiness report approval
- Handoff to documents workflow

**Missing logs = assessment incomplete** (cannot proceed to next phase)

**Full Documentation**: See `.github/instructions/agent-logging.instructions.md` for comprehensive standards.

## Success Criteria

Assessment workflow is complete when:

✅ **Prerequisites Fulfilled:**
- 90%+ of critical access requests granted
- Compliance and security clearances obtained
- PAT rotation policies documented

✅ **Assessment Complete:**
- All 8 dimensions evaluated with 80%+ confidence
- Stakeholder validation completed
- Findings aligned with team experience

✅ **Strategic Clarity:**
- Transformation roadmap prioritized and approved
- Success metrics defined and measurable
- Risk mitigation strategies documented

✅ **Handoff Ready:**
- AI Readiness Report finalized and approved
- Handoff package complete with all artifacts
- Documentation team briefed and ready to proceed

---

## Workflow Anti-Patterns

❌ **DON'T:**
- Start assessment without prerequisites request (blind spots guaranteed)
- Skip stakeholder validation (assumptions will be wrong)
- Generate report without confidence ratings (uncertainty hidden)
- Handoff without success metrics (no accountability)
- Proceed to documentation phase with <60% readiness score (setup for failure)

✅ **DO:**
- Request access early and track fulfillment proactively
- Validate findings with stakeholders throughout
- Document confidence levels and evidence sources
- Define measurable success criteria upfront
- Ensure readiness before advancing to next phase

## Timeline Estimates by Project Type

| Project Type | Prerequisites | Assessment | Stakeholder Validation | Report Generation | Total Duration |
|--------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Greenfield (Small)** | 5-7 days | 5-7 days | 2-3 days | 3-5 days | **15-22 days** |
| **Brownfield (Medium)** | 7-10 days | 7-10 days | 3-5 days | 3-5 days | **20-30 days** |
| **Enterprise (Large)** | 10-15 days | 10-15 days | 5-7 days | 5-7 days | **30-44 days** |
| **Regulated Industry** | 15-20 days | 10-15 days | 5-7 days | 5-7 days | **35-49 days** |

**Variables affecting timeline:**
- Organization size and complexity
- Number of systems requiring access
- Compliance approval layers
- Stakeholder availability
- Codebase size and maturity

---

## Continuous Improvement

After each assessment engagement:

**Retrospective (1 hour):**
- What went well?
- What surprised us?
- What would we do differently?
- What templates or processes need updates?

**Template Updates:**
- Refine assessment criteria based on findings
- Update confidence scoring guidance
- Enhance stakeholder validation questions
- Add new project type examples

**Knowledge Capture:**
- Document lessons learned
- Update best practices guide
- Contribute to framework improvement
