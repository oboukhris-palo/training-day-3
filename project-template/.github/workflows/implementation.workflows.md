# Implementation Workflow (Streamlined)

## Overview

This document defines the **Implementation & Development Execution Workflow** - the streamlined, layer-by-layer approach for converting completed PRD documents (from [documents.workflows.md](.github/workflows/documents.workflows.md)) into implemented, tested, and validated features.

**Key Architecture**:
- **User-Story Level Granulation**: Work happens one user-story at a time through all 4 layers before moving to the next
- **Layer-by-Layer Decomposition**: Lead Dev Agent decomposes each story into 4 layers (Database → Backend → Config → Frontend) at preparation time
- **TDD Orchestrator-Driven**: Once decomposition is complete, TDD-Orchestrator takes control and drives disciplined RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycles per layer
- **Epic Completion is Automatic**: An Epic is marked "Implemented" when **ALL of its User Stories are implemented**
- **Clear Handoff Points**: Lead Dev → TDD-Orchestrator → back to Lead Dev for next story

**Logging**: User story-specific TDD logs at `/logs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/agent-{name}-YYYYMMDD.md`

**Prerequisites**: All PDLC stages (1-6) must be completed with approved documents:
- ✅ requirements.md (business requirements) - stored in `/docs/01-requirements/`
- ✅ personas.md (user archetypes) - stored in `/docs/01-requirements/`
- ✅ **user-stories.md** (PRD document) - stored in `/docs/01-requirements/`
  - Created during PDLC Stage 4
  - Contains Epics (organizational groupings) and User Stories (work units)
  - Each user story includes BDD scenarios (Gherkin feature files)
  - **Read-only reference** for implementation
- ✅ **user-stories.md** (status tracking) - stored in `/docs/05-implementation/`
  - ⭐ **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for implementation progress (local)
  - Mirrors structure from `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md`
  - Adds status tracking: Not Started / In Progress / Implemented / Delivered
  - **Synchronized bidirectionally with GitHub Issues** (remote)
  - **PM checks this** to track progress across all user stories
  - **Orchestrator checks this** to determine next user-story
- ✅ architecture-design.md (system design) - stored in `/docs/02-architecture/`
- ✅ tech-spec.md (implementation specifications) - stored in `/docs/02-architecture/`
- ✅ design-systems.md (UI components and design tokens) - stored in `/docs/02-architecture/`
- ✅ test-strategies.md (testing approach) - stored in `/docs/03-testing/`
- ✅ **GitHub Repository Access** - Project must be hosted on GitHub with write access for:
  - Creating GitHub Issues for all user stories
  - Linking issues to parent epics
  - Updating issue status (Open → In Progress → Implemented → Delivered → Closed)
  - Synchronizing local `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` with GitHub Issues

## 📋 Agent Logging Requirements (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ UNBREAKABLE RULE: ALL agent interactions during implementation phase MUST be logged.**

### Logging Locations for Implementation Phase

**User Story-Specific TDD Logs**: `/logs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/agent-{name}-YYYYMMDD.md`

**Non-Story Implementation Logs**: `/logs/05-implementation/agent-{name}-YYYYMMDD.md`

### Agents Required to Log

| Agent | Primary Activities | Log Path |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| **dev-lead** | Implementation planning, folder structure creation, plan approval | `/logs/05-implementation/agent-dev-lead-YYYYMMDD.md` |
| **dev-tdd** | TDD orchestration (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR coordination) | `/logs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/agent-dev-tdd-YYYYMMDD.md` |
| **dev-tdd-red** | Write failing tests for current layer | `/logs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/agent-dev-tdd-red-YYYYMMDD.md` |
| **dev-tdd-green** | Implement minimal code to pass tests | `/logs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/agent-dev-tdd-green-YYYYMMDD.md` |
| **dev-tdd-refactor** | Improve code quality while maintaining green tests | `/logs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/agent-dev-tdd-refactor-YYYYMMDD.md` |
| **qa** | E2E testing, BDD validation, quality gates | `/logs/05-implementation/agent-qa-YYYYMMDD.md` |
| **orchestrator** | Workflow coordination, quality gate enforcement | `/logs/05-implementation/agent-orchestrator-YYYYMMDD.md` |

### Mandatory Logging Points

**Implementation Planning (Dev-Lead)**:
- Log implementation plan creation for each user story
- Log folder structure creation
- Log plan approval workflow
- Log architecture guidance and constraints

**TDD Cycles (dev-tdd-red/green/refactor)**:
- Log before each phase execution (RED, GREEN, REFACTOR)
- Log all file modifications
- Log test execution results
- Log chat-based handoff summary
- Log blockers immediately when encountered

**Quality Validation (QA)**:
- Log E2E test execution
- Log BDD scenario validation
- Log quality gate checks (coverage, complexity, standards)
- Log story completion validation

### Log Entry Template for TDD Agents

```markdown
## {TIMESTAMP} | Action: {DESCRIPTION} | Status: {success|failure|partial|blocked}

### Context
- **Phase**: IMPLEMENTATION
- **TDD Phase**: {RED|GREEN|REFACTOR}
- **Epic/Story**: {EPIC-REF}/{US-REF}
- **Layer**: {LAYER_NAME}
- **Cycle**: {CYCLE_NUMBER}

### Action Details
- **Action Type**: {test|write|refactor}
- **Files Touched**: 
  - {file1.ext}
  - {file2.ext}
- **Tools Used**: [{tools}]
- **PRU Consumed**: ~{estimate}

### Outcome
- **Status**: {status}
- **Changes Made**: 
  - {Description}
- **Quality Metrics**: 
  - Tests: {passed}/{total}
  - Coverage: {percentage}%
  - Complexity: {metric}
- **Blockers**: {None | description}
- **Rationale**: {why this implementation approach}

### Handoff
- **Next Step**: {awaiting|handoff_to_agent|continue|complete}
- **Next Agent**: {dev-tdd-green | dev-tdd-refactor | qa}
- **Handoff**: Chat-based (next agent reads conversation history + `.github/checkpoint.yaml`)
- **Instructions for Next Agent**: {Clear, actionable guidance — post in chat}

---
```

### Example TDD Log Entry

```markdown
## 2026-04-02T14:23:45Z | Action: Write failing test for user tier sync | Status: success

### Context
- **Phase**: IMPLEMENTATION
- **TDD Phase**: RED
- **Epic/Story**: AUTH-001/US-003
- **Layer**: Layer 1 (Database & Domain Model)
- **Cycle**: 018

### Action Details
- **Action Type**: test
- **Files Touched**: 
  - tests/Unit/Domain/UserServiceTests.cs
- **Tools Used**: [xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions]
- **PRU Consumed**: ~800

### Outcome
- **Status**: success
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Created failing test: SyncSubscriptionTier_ShouldUpdateBothUserAndSubscriptionTiers
  - Verified test fails as expected (no implementation yet)
- **Quality Metrics**: 
  - Tests: 0/1 (expected failure in RED phase)
  - Coverage: N/A
- **Blockers**: None
- **Rationale**: BDD scenario from features/user-authentication.feature requires tier synchronization

### Handoff
- **Next Step**: handoff_to_agent
- **Next Agent**: dev-tdd-green
- **Handoff**: Chat-based (dev-tdd-green reads conversation history + `.github/checkpoint.yaml`)
- **Instructions for Next Agent**: Implement minimal code to make SyncSubscriptionTier test pass. Must update BOTH User.tier AND Subscription.tier in service layer (critical: sync both tiers).

---
```

### Validation Enforcement

**TDD Orchestrator validates logs**:
- Before each TDD phase handoff (RED → GREEN, GREEN → REFACTOR)
- After each layer completion
- Before story completion sign-off
- At quality gate checkpoints

**Dev-Lead validates logs**:
- During implementation plan approval
- When reviewing TDD progress
- Before merging story branches

**Missing logs = incomplete implementation** (cannot proceed to next phase/story)

**Full Documentation**: See `.github/instructions/agent-logging.instructions.md` for comprehensive standards.

## Template Metadata Reference Guide

### Purpose

Document metadata references maintain traceability between generated implementation documents and their template sources (`epic-tmpl.yml` and `user-story-tmpl.yml`). This enables:
- Clear audit trail of document generation
- Easy reference back to template definitions
- Consistency validation across all documents
- Template version tracking over time

### Metadata Format

All generated implementation documents must include metadata block at the top (YAML frontmatter format):

#### Epic README Metadata Example

**File**: `/docs/05-implementation/epics/AUTH-001/readme.md`

```yaml
---
generated_from_template: epic-tmpl.yml
template_path: .github/templates/epic-tmpl.yml
generation_date: 2026-04-01
generator_agent: dev-lead
epic_key: AUTH-001
project_key: PROJ
schema_version: "1.0.0"
---

# Epic: AUTH-001 - User Authentication

**Epic Key**: AUTH-001  
**Status**: To Do  
**Priority**: High  
**Team Lead**: john.doe@example.com  

## Overview
[Epic content follows...]
```

#### User Story Description Metadata Example

**File**: `/docs/05-implementation/epics/AUTH-001/user-stories/AUTH-001-US-001/description.md`

```yaml
---
generated_from_template: user-story-tmpl.yml
template_path: .github/templates/user-story-tmpl.yml
generation_date: 2026-04-01
generator_agent: dev-lead
story_key: AUTH-001-US-001
epic_key: AUTH-001
project_key: PROJ
schema_version: "1.0.0"
---

# User Story: AUTH-001-US-001

**Story Key**: AUTH-001-US-001  
**Epic**: AUTH-001 (User Authentication)  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: High  

## User Story Format

As a **registered user**,  
I want to **log in with my credentials**,  
So that **I can access my account securely**.

[Story content follows...]
```

### Metadata Fields

| Field | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `generated_from_template` | Yes | Template YAML filename | `epic-tmpl.yml` or `user-story-tmpl.yml` |
| `template_path` | Yes | Relative path to template | `.github/templates/epic-tmpl.yml` |
| `generation_date` | Yes | ISO 8601 date when document was generated | `2026-04-01` |
| `generator_agent` | Yes | Agent responsible for generation | `dev-lead`, `ba`, `pm` |
| `epic_key` | Yes (stories) | Parent epic identifier | `AUTH-001`, `CORE-001` |
| `project_key` | Yes | Project identifier | `PROJ`, `MERCHANT` |
| `schema_version` | Optional | Template schema version for migration tracking | `1.0.0`, `2.0.0` |
| `story_key` | Yes (stories) | Unique story identifier | `AUTH-001-US-001` |

### Best Practices

1. **Always include metadata block** at the very top of generated documents (before any content)
2. **Use ISO 8601 format** for dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`
3. **Reference template files** using relative paths from repository root: `#file:.github/templates/epic-tmpl.yml`
4. **Keep metadata current** - update generation_date if document is regenerated
5. **Document schema version** when template structure changes to support future migrations
6. **Link back to PRD sources** in the content sections (e.g., "Copied from `/docs/01-requirements/themes/epics/{EPIC-KEY}/epic.yml`")

### Traceability Workflow

```
1. Template Definition
   ↓
   .github/templates/epic-tmpl.yml
   .github/templates/user-story-tmpl.yml
   ↓
2. Document Generation (Phase 0 / Phase 2)
   ↓
   Developer reads template → Creates document with metadata reference
   ↓
3. Metadata Block Added
   ↓
   ```yaml
   generated_from_template: epic-tmpl.yml
   template_path: .github/templates/epic-tmpl.yml
   ```
   ↓
4. Document Ready for Use
   ↓
   /docs/05-implementation/epics/{EPIC-KEY}/readme.md
   /docs/05-implementation/epics/{EPIC-KEY}/user-stories/{US-REF}/description.md
   ↓
5. Validation (Quality Gates)
   ↓
   Verify metadata present and correct
   Verify epic/story keys match file paths
   Verify generation_date is recent
```

## Agent Communication Patterns

### Document-Based Communication Rules

**Agents must communicate their work, research, analysis, and reporting through these checkpoint documents. Agents update these documents when needed as long as it's within their responsibilities.**

**🤖 AI ACTIVITY LOGGING INTEGRATION**: All agents use `ImplementationWorkflowInterceptor` to track patterns, optimize workflows, and generate insights. Logging is enabled by default and captures:
- Agent handoffs and decision points
- TDD cycle efficiency and bottlenecks  
- Sprint planning decisions and velocity trends
- Document synchronization and GitHub integration
- Story lifecycle transitions and validation results
- Epic progression and cross-dependencies

#### PM Agent Communication
- **Primary Documents**: `/docs/05-implementation/project-status.md`, `/docs/05-implementation/current-sprint.md`
- **Updates**: Daily for blockers and progress tracking, weekly for metrics and planning
- **Communication**: Project status reports, sprint planning decisions, resource allocation
- **Escalation Triggers**: Stories blocked >4 hours, velocity trends, capacity issues
- **🤖 AI Logging**: Sprint scope decisions (Conservative/Balanced/Stretch), capacity utilization, story selection patterns, GitHub issue creation and synchronization

#### Dev-Lead Agent Communication  
- **Primary Documents**: `/docs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/implementation-plan.md`, `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md`
- **Updates**: During Phase 3 (plan creation), Phase 5 (status sync), quality gate reviews
- **Communication**: Technical decomposition, architectural decisions, implementation readiness
- **Handoff Notes**: Clear technical specifications for TDD agents, dependency resolution
- **🤖 AI Logging**: Layer decomposition decisions, architecture choices, technical debt identification, implementation plan quality metrics, status synchronization patterns

#### TDD Agent Communication (tdd-orchestrator, tdd-red, tdd-green, tdd-refactor)
- **Primary Documents**: 
  - Progress tracking: `/docs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/implementation-plan.md` (checkboxes mark [x] as tasks complete)
  - Audit trail: Git commits with format `TDD-<US-REF>-<PHASE>-<CYCLE>-YYYYMMDD: [description]` (YYYYMMDD = current date)
- **Updates**: After each TDD phase (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR), mark checkbox [x] in plan, commit with cycle format
- **Communication**: Current phase status via checkboxes, next actions in plan, blockers in plan-approval.yaml, test results in git commit messages
- **Chain of Thought**: Git commit messages provide phase-specific context and troubleshooting details
- **🤖 AI Logging**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle efficiency, test coverage trends, code complexity metrics, refactoring frequency, layer-specific bottlenecks, BDD assertion coverage

#### QA Agent Communication
- **Primary Documents**: `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md`, `/docs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/us-completition-checklist.md`, GitHub Issue comments
- **Updates**: After validation testing, bug discovery, story acceptance, DoD verification
- **Communication**: E2E test results, bug reports, quality metrics, acceptance criteria verification
- **Quality Gates**: Feature readiness, design compliance, accessibility validation, performance SLA, security checks
- **🤖 AI Logging**: E2E test pass rates, bug discovery patterns, test coverage trends, design system compliance, exploratory testing coverage, acceptance criteria verification, regression test results, accessibility compliance rates

### Document Update Triggers

| Agent | Trigger | Document | Content |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| **PM** | Sprint start | `current-sprint.md` | Selected stories, capacity, team assignments |
| **PM** | Daily standup | `project-status.md` | Progress metrics, blockers, risk updates |

### Communication Quality Standards

1. **Timeliness**: Update documents within 1 hour of completing work
2. **Clarity**: Use clear, actionable language; avoid technical jargon for non-technical stakeholders
3. **Traceability**: Reference exact US-REF, GitHub issue numbers, commit hashes
4. **Context**: Provide enough context for the next agent to continue work seamlessly
5. **Escalation**: Flag blockers immediately; don't wait for daily standup
6. **Consistency**: Use standardized formats and terminology across all documents

**🤖 AI-POWERED OPTIMIZATION**: Weekly analysis reports identify communication bottlenecks, suggest workflow improvements, and track cost optimization opportunities. Generated reports include:
- Agent handoff efficiency scores and bottleneck identification
- TDD cycle optimization recommendations per layer
- Sprint planning velocity trends and capacity utilization
- Story lifecycle bottleneck analysis and improvement suggestions
- Epic progression patterns and cross-dependency optimization
- Cost impact analysis and ROI calculations for process improvements

**Activities**:
1. **Verify GitHub Repository Access**:
   - Confirm repository exists and agent has write access
   - Verify permissions to create issues, labels, and milestones
   - Validate repository structure matches project requirements

2. **Create Tracking Document**:
   - Create `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` (if doesn't exist) or identify existing "Not Started" or "In Progress" user-story that needs implementation
   - Verify GitHub issue number exists for this story

2. **Validate Prerequisites Exist**:
   - ✅ GitHub Issue exists and is accessible
   - ✅ `/docs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<USER-STORY-REF>/implementation-plan.md` exists and is complete
   - ✅ `features/<domain>/<story-ref>.feature` file exists with BDD scenarios

**Input**: `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` with GitHub issue numbers, status from `/docs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<USER-STORY-REF>/`, GitHub Issue API  
**Output**: Validation report, blocker detection with GitHub issue link, handoff to Phase 2 (if needed) or Phase 3 (if ready)  
**Outcome**: Ensure TDD execution starts with complete technical specification and GitHub tracking

5. **Setup PM Dashboard**:
   - PM uses `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` as primary tracking view
   - Track counts: Total stories, Not Started, In Progress, Implemented, Delivered
   - Monitor velocity: Stories completed per sprint
   - Identify blockers: Stories stuck in same status >2 days

6. **Commit and Handoff**:
   - Commit `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` and GitHub Issue number (e.g., #123)
   - Review `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md` for story details and BDD scenarios
   - Review GitHub Issue for acceptance criteria and any stakeholder comments

2. **Update GitHub Issue Status**:
   - Change GitHub Issue status from "Not Started" to "In Progress"
   - Add comment: "🚀 Starting implementation planning. Creating layer decomposition and BDD tests."
   - Update `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md`: Mark status "In Progress" (synchronized with GitHub)
**PM Continuous Monitoring**:
- **Daily**: Check `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` for status changes
- **Weekly**: Report to stakeholders: Stories delivered, stories in progress, projected completion
- **Per Sprint**: Calculate velocity, adjust sprint planning based on team capacity

### PHASE 3.5: PLAN APPROVAL GATE (HUMAN VALIDATION)

**Goal**: Require human approval of implementation plan before TDD execution begins

**Prerequisites**: Phase 2 completed (implementation-plan.md exists and complete)

**Activities**:

1. **Check for Plan Approval**:
   - Look for `/docs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/plan-approval.yaml`
   - Validate approval status:
     - ✅ `status: approved` → Proceed to Phase 4
     - ❌ `status: changes-requested` → BLOCK execution, notify Dev-Lead
     - ❌ `status: revoked` → BLOCK execution (plan was modified after approval)
     - ❌ **File missing** → Create approval file, request Dev-Lead review

2. **If Approval File Missing**:
   - Create `/docs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<US-REF>/plan-approval.yaml` from template
   - Pre-fill with:
     - `story: <US-REF>`
     - `plan_version: v1`
     - `scope: [Layer1, Layer2, Layer3, Layer4]` or specific layers
     - `risk: low|medium|high` (assess based on story complexity)
     - `status: changes-requested` (requires review)
   - **Present to Dev-Lead**:
     - "Implementation plan created for <US-REF>. Review required before TDD execution."
     - "Complete validation checklist in plan-approval.yaml"
     - "Set status to 'approved' when ready for execution"

3. **If Status is `changes-requested`**:
   - **BLOCK TDD execution**
   - Present feedback to Dev-Lead:
     - Review notes from `plan-approval.yaml`
     - Specific checklist items marked `verified: false`
   - Wait for Dev-Lead to:
     - Address feedback
     - Update implementation-plan.md if needed
     - Set `status: approved` in plan-approval.yaml

4. **If Status is `revoked`**:
   - **BLOCK TDD execution**
   - **Reason**: Implementation plan was modified after approval
   - **Auto-revocation triggered by**:
     - Any edit to `implementation-plan.md`
     - Plan version mismatch (`plan_version` != current version)
   - **Required Actions**:
     - Create snapshot: `implementation-plan-v{N}.md` (IMMUTABLE historical copy)
     - Update `implementation-plan.md` version in header
     - Update `plan-approval.yaml`:
       - Set `plan_version: v{N+1}`
       - Set `status: changes-requested`
       - Add note explaining what changed
     - Request Dev-Lead re-approval

5. **If Status is `approved`**:
   - ✅ **Proceed to Phase 4 (TDD Execution)**
   - Freeze implementation-plan.md (read-only reference)
   - Log approval event:
     - Approver role and name (from approval file)
     - Approval date
     - Plan version approved
     - Scope (layers covered)

6. **YOLO Mode Override** (Advanced Users Only):
   - **Purpose**: Skip approval gate for rapid prototyping or low-risk stories
   - **Activation**: User explicitly requests YOLO mode with acknowledged risks
   - **Pre-flight Checks** (Auto-executed before YOLO):
     - ✅ All BDD tests written and failing
     - ✅ Git working tree clean (all changes committed)
     - ✅ Implementation plan exists and is complete
     - ✅ No open blockers in story checklist
   - **Safety Rails**:
     - **Single-cycle lock**: Only ONE TDD cycle can run in YOLO mode
     - **Auto-abort on regression**: If ANY existing test fails, abort immediately
     - **Mandatory review after cycle**: Human review required before next cycle
   - **Activation Command**:
     - User: `@orchestrator YOLO mode for <US-REF> (I acknowledge the risks)`
   - **Orchestrator Response**:
     - Present pre-flight check results
     - List risks (no architect review, potential rework, etc.)
     - Ask for explicit confirmation: "Type 'CONFIRMED' to proceed"
   - **After YOLO Cycle Completes**:
     - Create `plan-approval.yaml` with `status: changes-requested`
     - Add note: "YOLO cycle completed. Review recommended before continuing."
     - Require normal approval for subsequent cycles

**Input**: implementation-plan.md (complete), plan-approval.yaml (if exists)  
**Output**: Approval validation result, approval file creation (if needed), YOLO mode activation (if requested)  
**Outcome**: Human validation completed before TDD execution, or YOLO mode activated with risk acknowledgment

**Approval Checklist** (Validated in `plan-approval.yaml`):
- [ ] Implementation plan follows layer architecture (DB → Service → API → UI)
- [ ] BDD scenarios map to implementation layers
- [ ] All external dependencies documented and available
- [ ] Database migration order is correct
- [ ] Critical business logic requirements addressed (e.g., tier synchronization)
- [ ] Error handling strategy defined
- [ ] Performance considerations documented
- [ ] Security requirements addressed

**Orchestrator Behavior Matrix**:

| Scenario | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Approval file missing | N/A | Create file, request Dev-Lead review |
| Status: `approved` | ✅ | Proceed to Phase 4 (TDD execution) |
| Status: `changes-requested` | ❌ | BLOCK execution, present feedback to Dev-Lead |
| Status: `revoked` | ❌ | BLOCK execution, explain auto-revocation reason |
| Plan modified after approval | Auto-revoke | Create snapshot, update version, request re-approval |
| YOLO mode requested | Override | Run pre-flight checks, get confirmation, proceed with single cycle |
| YOLO cycle completed | Mandatory review | Auto-create approval file, require review before next cycle |

### PHASE 4: TDD-ORCHESTRATOR EXECUTION (DRIVEN BY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN)

**Goal**: Implement all 4 layers using disciplined TDD cycles, guided by implementation-plan and driven by failing BDD tests. **Implementation IS simply applying TDD to the implementation-plan specification.**

**🔴 CRITICAL VALIDATION BEFORE STARTING**:
- Verify <USER-STORY-REF> matches EXACTLY in:
  - implementation-plan.md file path: `/docs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<EXACT-US-REF>/implementation-plan.md`
  - implementation-plan.md header section
  - /docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md
  - /docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md (source of truth)
  - GitHub Issue title (should include [US-XXX])
- If ANY divergence found: STOP immediately and escalate to PM/Lead Dev to correct before proceeding
- Do NOT proceed with implementation if numbering is inconsistent

**Flow**:
```
TDD-Orchestrator reads: /docs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<USER-STORY-REF>/implementation-plan.md

FOR each layer (Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3 → Layer 4):
  READ: implementation-plan.md section for this layer
    └─ Note: Files to create, TDD approach, architectural constraints, BDD assertions for this layer
  
  RED PHASE: Write failing test code
    └─ Use TDD-RED Agent to write test code per implementation-plan.md
    └─ Tests verify file creation, structure, and BDD assertion support
    └─ Tests should FAIL (implementation doesn't exist yet)
  
  GREEN PHASE: Implement minimum code to pass tests
    └─ Use TDD-GREEN Agent to write production code per implementation-plan.md
    └─ Follow file list and structure in implementation-plan.md exactly
    └─ Implement just enough to make RED tests pass
    └─ Verify: BDD assertions for this layer now pass
  
  REFACTOR PHASE: Improve code quality while keeping tests passing
    └─ Use TDD-REFACTOR Agent to clean code per implementation-plan.md constraints
    └─ Apply SOLID principles, remove duplication, clarify structure
    └─ Verify: All tests still pass, code quality improved

  COMMIT: Layer complete, tests passing, code reviewed

AFTER ALL LAYERS:
  RUN: Full BDD test suite for entire story → ALL passing
  UPDATE: /docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md → Mark "Implemented"
  HAND OFF: Return to Orchestrator "Story complete. All BDD tests passing. Ready for next story."
```

**Layer-Specific TDD Details**:

**Layer 1: Database**
- No TDD cycle (no unit tests needed)
- TDD-GREEN directly writes Liquibase/SQL migration scripts
- Verify: Migration runs, schema created, models can interact with DB
- BDD assertions enabled: Data persistence, schema validation
- No unit tests to refactor

**Layer 2: Backend**
- **TDD-RED**: Write controller tests (mock service calls), then service tests (mock repository calls)
- **TDD-GREEN**: Implement controllers → services → repositories to make tests pass
- **TDD-REFACTOR**: Improve separation of concerns, reduce duplication
- BDD assertions enabled: API endpoints, business logic, data validation

**Output During Execution**:
- **After Each Layer**: Add comment to GitHub Issue:
  - "✅ Layer N complete: <layer-name>. Tests passing. BDD assertions enabled: <list>."
  - Commit code with message referencing issue (e.g., "feat(US-001): Implement database layer #123")
- **After Layer 4**: All implementation code committed to repository

**Input**: Implementation-plan.md (complete specification), failing BDD tests, selected TDD approach, GitHub Issue number, architecture-design.md, test-strategies.md  
**Output**: Implemented and tested code for all 4 layers (following implementation-plan.md), all BDD tests passing, unit/integration tests per layer (>80% coverage), commits linked to GitHub Issue  
**Outcome**: User-story fully implemented per specification, BDD scenarios passing, ready for Dev-Lead status synchronization
GitHub Repository Access**: Project MUST be on GitHub with write access. No GitHub = workflow cannot proceed.
2. **Implementation-Plan Quality**: The more detailed the plan (layer breakdown, files to create, BDD assertions per layer), the faster TDD-Orchestrator executes
3. **Failing BDD Tests as Entry Point**: BDD tests are not validation at the end—they are the specification that drives implementation
4. **One Story at a Time**: Complete all phases (Prep → TDD → Sync → Validation) for one story before moving to next
5. **Synchronization Discipline**: Lead Dev MUST update both `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` AND GitHub Issue after each phase (In Progress → Implemented)
6. **QA Validation Gate**: No story moves to "Delivered" without QA validation. Bugs block progression.
7. **Status Tracking**: `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` is local source of truth, synchronized with GitHub Issues (remote source of truth)
8. **PM Monitoring**: PM continuously checks progress counts (Not Started, In Progress, Implemented, Delivered) to track team velocity
9. **Epic Tracking**: Stories are tagged with parent epic in GitHub; when all stories of an epic are "Delivered", epic is automatically "Delivered"
10. **Clear Layer Boundaries**: Each layer has specific scope (DB doesn't test code, Backend doesn't test UI), makes TDD cycles clean and fast

**Prereq0 → Phase 1 (PM → Orchestrator)**:
- [ ] GitHub repository access verified (write permissions)
- [ ] `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` created with all user-stories
- [ ] GitHub Issues created for ALL user-stories
- [ ] Epic labels created and applied to issues
- [ ] All stories initialized with status "Not Started"
- [ ] All stories have GitHub issue numbers stored in user-stories.md

- [ ] GitHub Issue number retrieved (e.g., #123)
- [ ] User-story details available in `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md`
- [ ] Message: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) requires implementation-plan.md and BDD tests. Please prepare."

**Phase 2 → Phase 3 (Lead Dev → Orchestrator)**:
- [ ] User-story decomposed into 4 clear layers
- [ ] Implementation-plan.md created with all 4 layers detailed and committed
- [ ] BDD feature file created with Gherkin scenarios and committed
- [ ] Step definitions created with failing test code and committed
- [ ] BDD tests run and confirmed failing
- [ ] GitHub Issue updated: Status changed to "In Progress"
- [ ] GitHub Issue updated: Comment added with implementation-plan.md link and BDD test results
- [ ] `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` updated to "In Progress" (synchronized with GitHub)
- [ ] Message: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) ready for TDD execution. implementation-plan.md complete, BDD tests failing."

**Phase 3 → Phase 4 (Orchestrator → TDD-Orchestrator)**:
- [ ] Orchestrator validated implementation-plan.md is complete
- [ ] Orchestrator confirmed failing BDD tests exist
- [ ] User selected TDD execution approach
- [ ] GitHub Issue updated: Comment added "Starting TDD execution with <approach>"
- [ ] GitHub Issue number passed to TDD-Orchestrator
- [ ] Message: "Implement per implementation-plan.md using <approach> TDD (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR) per layer. Update Issue #<ISSUE-NUM> after each layer."

**Phase 4 → Phase 5 (TDD-Orchestrator → Lead Dev)**:
- [ ] All 4 layers implemented following implementation-plan.md
- [ ] All BDD scenarios passing
- [ ] Unit/integration tests written per layer (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Code follows coding.instructions.md
- [ ] All implementation code committed with issue references (e.g., "#123" in commits)
- [ ] GitHub Issue updated: Comments added after each layer completion
- [ ] Message: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) implementation complete. All BDD tests passing. Ready for status sync."
0** | PM | `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md`, GitHub credentials | GitHub Issues for all stories, `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` with issue numbers | 1-2 hours (one-time setup) |
| **PHASE 1** | Orchestrator | `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` with GitHub issue numbers | Validation report, blocker detection, handoff to Phase 2 or Phase 3 | 15-30 min |
| **PHASE 2** | Lead Dev | User-story reference, GitHub Issue #, PRD docs, architectural specs | implementation-plan.md, BDD tests, GitHub Issue updated to "In Progress" | 1-2 hours per story |
| **PHASE 3** | Orchestrator | Handoff from Lead Dev with complete plan, GitHub Issue # | TDD execution launch, selected approach, GitHub Issue updated | 15-30 min |
| **PHASE 4** | TDD-Orchestrator | implementation-plan.md, failing BDD tests, approach, GitHub Issue # | Implemented code, passing BDD tests, >80% coverage, commits linked to issue | 2-5 days per story |
| **PHASE 5** | Lead Dev | Handoff from TDD with BDD results, GitHub Issue # | `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` and GitHub Issue both "Implemented", handoff to QA | 15-30 min |
| **PHASE 6** | QA | User-story reference, GitHub Issue #, BDD feature files, running app | Validation report, `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` and GitHub Issue both "Delivered" (or bugs documented) | 1-3 hours per story |

**Iteration**: Repeat Phases 1-6 for each user-story in sprint until all selected stories are "Delivered"

**Epic Completion**: Automatic when ALL user-stories in an epic are marked "Delivered" (validated by QA)

**PM Continuous Monitoring**: PM checks `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` daily for progress (counts of Not Started, In Progress, Implemented, Delivered)

**Key Constraints**: 
- Phase 0 MUST complete first - no GitHub Issues = workflow cannot proceed
- Phase 4 (TDD execution) CANNOT begin until Phase 2 (implementation-plan.md creation) is complete
- Phase 6 (next story) CANNOT begin until current story is "Delivered" by QA validation
- Bugs found in Phase 6 block progression until fixed and re-validated

**Synchronization Points**:
- **Local**: `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` (committed to repository)
- **Remote**: GitHub Issues (status: Open → In Progress → Implemented → Delivered → Closed)
- **Lead Dev Responsibility**: Keep both synchronized after each phase
**Phase 6 → Phase 1 (QA → Orchestrator)**:
- **If Validation PASSES**:
  - [ ] BDD tests passing in browser (E2E validation complete)
  - [ ] Exploratory testing complete (all workflows validated)
  - [ ] Design system compliance verified
  - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
  - [ ] Validation report documented in GitHub Issue
  - [ ] Screenshots attached to GitHub Issue
  - [ ] `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` updated to "Delivered" and committed
  - [ ] GitHub Issue updated: Status changed to "Delivered"
  - [ ] Synchronization verified: local status == GitHub Issue status
  - [ ] Message: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) delivered. Validation complete. Ready for next story."
- **If Validation FAILS**:
  - [ ] Bugs documented in GitHub Issue with details (description, repro steps, severity)
  - [ ] Screenshots/logs attached to GitHub Issue
  - [ ] "Bug" label added to GitHub Issue
  - [ ] Status remains "Implemented" (NOT "Delivered")
  - [ ] Message: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) validation failed. Bugs documented. Please fix and notify for re-validation."
  - [ ] **Workflow pauses** - do NOT proceed to next story until bugs fixed
     - BDD feature file path for validation
     - List of implemented features/endpoints
     - Message: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) implemented. All BDD tests passing. Ready for validation testing."

**Input**: Handoff from TDD-Orchestrator with BDD test results and commits, `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md`, GitHub Issue number  
**Output**: `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` updated to "Implemented" (committed), GitHub Issue updated with completion details and "Implemented" status, handoff to QA  
**Outcome**: Complete synchronization between local tracking and GitHub, clear handoff to QA for validation

**Lead Dev Responsibilities Summary**:
- **After each iteration** (Phase 4 completion): Update status to "Implemented"
- **After each user-story** implemented: Synchronize local and GitHub tracking
- **Continuous**: Monitor GitHub Issues for comments, blockers, or status changes from QA

---

### PHASE 6: QA VALIDATES FEATURE (DELIVERED)

**Goal**: Execute comprehensive validation testing using Playwright E2E tests to confirm feature meets acceptance criteria, then mark as "Delivered"

**Prerequisites**: Phase 5 complete with user-story status "Implemented" and all BDD tests passing

**Activities**:
1. **Receive Handoff from Lead Dev**:
   - User-story reference (e.g., US-001)
   - GitHub Issue number and link
   - BDD feature file path: `features/<domain>/<story-ref>.feature`
   - List of implemented features/endpoints
   - Review GitHub Issue acceptance criteria

2. **Setup Validation Environment**:
   - Ensure application is running (local dev server or staging environment)
   - Install Playwright browsers if needed: `mcp_microsoft_pla_browser_install`
   - Review BDD scenarios to understand expected behavior

3. **Execute BDD Tests in Browser (E2E Validation)**:
   - Run BDD tests via Playwright: Execute Gherkin scenarios with browser automation
   - Capture: Screenshots on failure, console logs, network requests
   - Validate: All Given-When-Then steps execute correctly in real browser

4. **Perform Exploratory Testing**:
   - Test user workflows end-to-end (beyond BDD scenarios)
   - Verify edge cases: Empty states, validation errors, boundary conditions
   - Test error handling: Invalid inputs, network failures, timeouts
   - Cross-browser testing (if required): Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Mobile responsiveness (if required)

5. **Validate Design System Compliance**:
   - Review `/docs/design/design-systems.md` for design tokens and components
   - Verify: Colors, typography, spacing, component styling match design system
   - Take screenshots for visual regression (optional)

6. **Validate Against Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Cross-reference GitHub Issue acceptance criteria with implemented feature
   - Ensure all criteria are met (checked off in issue comments)

7. **Document Test Results**:
   - Create validation report:
     - BDD test results: X/X scenarios passing
     - Exploratory test findings: Pass/Fail per workflow
     - Design system compliance: Pass/Fail
     - Acceptance criteria checklist: All ✅
     - Screenshots: Key workflows (attach to GitHub Issue)
     - Browser/device coverage: Tested on X browsers

8. **If Validation FAILS**:
   - Document bugs in GitHub Issue:
     - Comment: "❌ Validation failed. Bugs found:"
     - List bugs with: Description, Steps to reproduce, Expected vs Actual, Severity
     - Attach: Screenshots, console logs, network traces
   - Add "Bug" label to GitHub Issue
   - Keep status "Implemented" (not "Delivered")
   - Hand back to Lead Dev: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) validation failed. Bugs documented in issue. Please address and notify when ready for re-validation."
   - **Do NOT proceed to next user-story until bugs are fixed**

9. **If Validation PASSES**:
   - Update `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md`: Change status from "Implemented" to "Delivered"
   - Commit user-stories.md with message: "chore: Mark US-<REF> as Delivered after QA validation #<ISSUE-NUM>"
   - Update GitHub Issue:
     - Change status to "Delivered" (or add "Delivered" label)
     - Add comment: "✅ Validation complete. All tests passing."
     - Attach validation report (test results, screenshots, coverage)
     - Close issue or move to "Done" column (per project workflow)
   - Hand off to Orchestrator: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) delivered. Validation complete. Ready for next story."

**Input**: Handoff from Lead Dev with user-story reference and GitHub Issue link, BDD feature files, running application  
**Output**: Validation report, `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` updated to "Delivered" (or bugs documented), GitHub Issue updated to "Delivered" (or "Bug" label added)

- **TDD-REFACTOR**: Simplify component logic, extract subcomponents
- BDD assertions enabled: UI rendering, user interactions, data display

**Input**: Implementation-plan.md (complete specification), failing BDD tests, selected TDD approach, architecture-design.md, test-strategies.md  
**Output**: Implemented and tested code for all 4 layers (following implementation-plan.md), all BDD tests passing, unit/integration tests per layer (>80% coverage), `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` updated to "Implemented"  
**Outcome**: User-story fully implemented per specification, BDD scenarios passing, ready for next story iteration

## Critical Success Factors

1. **🔴 NUMBERING CONSISTENCY (MOST CRITICAL)**: All references to user-stories MUST use exact <USER-STORY-REF> from `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md`. No abbreviations, typos, or renumbering schemes allowed. Any divergence breaks orchestration workflow.
   - Validate at EVERY phase handoff
   - Source of truth: `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md`
   - Check: current-sprint.md, implementation-plan.md paths, GitHub Issue titles, /docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md
   - Pause workflow immediately if ANY inconsistency found
2. **Implementation-Plan Quality**: The more detailed the plan (layer breakdown, files to create, BDD assertions per layer), the faster TDD-Orchestrator executes
3. **Failing BDD Tests as Entry Point**: BDD tests are not validation at the end—they are the specification that drives implementation
4. **One Story at a Time**: Complete all 4 layers for one story before moving to next, ensures focused work and clean git history
5. **Clear Layer Boundaries**: Each layer has specific scope (DB doesn't test code, Backend doesn't test UI), makes TDD cycles clean and fast
6. **Status Tracking**: `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` is the orchestrator's source of truth for what to do next
7. **Epic Tracking**: Stories are tagged with parent epic; when all stories of an epic are "Implemented", epic is automatically "Implemented"

## Summary Table

| Phase | Agent | Input | Output | Duration | Checkpoint Documents Updated |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|----------|------------------------------|
| **PHASE 0** | PM | `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md`, GitHub credentials | GitHub Issues, `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md`, `/docs/05-implementation/project-status.md` | 1-2 hours | `project-status.md` (initial setup) |
| **PHASE 1** | PM | `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md` (source of truth for US-REF), `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` | Validation: `current-sprint.md` references MATCH `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md` exactly, GitHub Issues created with exact US-REF | 15-30 min | `current-sprint.md` (create), `project-status.md` (sprint planning) |
| **PHASE 2** | BA | User-story (exact US-REF from PRD), current-sprint.md (validated references) | `/docs/05-implementation/epics/<EPIC-REF>/user-stories/<EXACT-US-REF>/description.md` enriched, numbering validated | 1-2 hours per story | `description.md` (enrichment sections) |
| **PHASE 3** | Dev-Lead | User-story (exact US-REF), enriched file, PRD/architecture/design docs | `implementation-plan.md`, `plan-approval.yaml`, BDD scenarios in `features/`, numbering pre-validated | 1-2 hours per story | `implementation-plan.md` (create), `plan-approval.yaml` (create), `features/` (BDD scenarios) |
| **PHASE 4** | TDD-Orchestrator | implementation-plan.md (numbering pre-validated, approved), failing BDD tests, approach | Implemented code, passing BDD tests, >80% coverage, commits reference exact US-REF | 2-5 days per story | `implementation-plan.md` (checkboxes [x]), git commits (`TDD-<US-REF>-<PHASE>-<CYCLE>`), `current-sprint.md` (daily updates) |
| **PHASE 5** | Dev-Lead | Handoff from TDD with BDD results, exact US-REF | `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` "Implemented" (exact US-REF), GitHub Issue updated, handoff to QA | 15-30 min | `user-stories.md` (status update) |
| **PHASE 6** | QA | User-story (exact US-REF), GitHub Issue, BDD files | `/docs/05-implementation/user-stories.md` "Delivered" (exact US-REF), GitHub Issue closed | 1-3 hours per story | `user-stories.md` (validation result) |

**🔴 CRITICAL VALIDATION GATE**: Before every phase handoff, verify <USER-STORY-REF> matches EXACTLY with `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md`. Any divergence blocks progression.

**Document Communication**: All agents communicate work, research, analysis, and reporting through these checkpoint documents. Updates are required within their scope of responsibility.

**Iteration**: Repeat Phases 1-6 for each user-story in sprint until all selected stories are "Delivered"

**Epic Completion**: Automatic when ALL user-stories in an epic are marked "Delivered"

**Key Constraints**: 
- Phase 4 (TDD execution) CANNOT begin until Phase 3 (implementation-plan.md creation) is complete
- **NUMBERING CONSISTENCY IS CRITICAL**: All <USER-STORY-REF> must match exactly with `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md`
- **Validation Gate**: Before every phase handoff, verify 1:1 match between current-sprint.md, implementation-plan.md paths, GitHub Issue titles, and `/docs/01-requirements/user-stories.md`
