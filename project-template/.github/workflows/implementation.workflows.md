# Implementation Workflow (Streamlined)

## Overview

This document defines the **Implementation & Development Execution Workflow** - the streamlined, layer-by-layer approach for converting completed PRD documents (from [documents.workflows.md](.github/workflows/documents.workflows.md)) into implemented, tested, and validated features.

**Key Architecture**:
- **User-Story Level Granulation**: Work happens one user-story at a time through all 4 layers before moving to the next
- **Layer-by-Layer Decomposition**: Lead Dev Agent decomposes each story into 4 layers (Database → Backend → Config → Frontend) at preparation time
- **TDD Orchestrator-Driven**: Once decomposition is complete, TDD-Orchestrator takes control and drives disciplined RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycles per layer
- **Epic Completion is Automatic**: An Epic is marked "Implemented" when **ALL of its User Stories are implemented**
- **Clear Handoff Points**: Lead Dev → TDD-Orchestrator → back to Lead Dev for next story

**Prerequisites**: All PDLC stages (1-6) must be completed with approved documents:
- ✅ requirements.md (business requirements) - stored in `/docs/prd/`
- ✅ personas.md (user archetypes) - stored in `/docs/prd/`
- ✅ **user-stories.md** (PRD document) - stored in `/docs/prd/`
  - Created during PDLC Stage 4
  - Contains Epics (organizational groupings) and User Stories (work units)
  - Each user story includes BDD scenarios (Gherkin feature files)
  - **Read-only reference** for implementation
- ✅ **user-stories.md** (status tracking) - stored in `/docs/user-stories/`
  - ⭐ **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for implementation progress (local)
  - Mirrors structure from `/docs/prd/user-stories.md`
  - Adds status tracking: Not Started / In Progress / Implemented / Delivered
  - **Synchronized bidirectionally with GitHub Issues** (remote)
  - **PM checks this** to track progress across all user stories
  - **Orchestrator checks this** to determine next user-story
- ✅ architecture-design.md (system design) - stored in `/docs/prd/`
- ✅ tech-spec.md (implementation specifications) - stored in `/docs/prd/`
- ✅ design-systems.md (UI components and design tokens) - stored in `/docs/design/`
- ✅ test-strategies.md (testing approach) - stored in `/docs/prd/`
- ✅ **GitHub Repository Access** - Project must be hosted on GitHub with write access for:
  - Creating GitHub Issues for all user stories
  - Linking issues to parent epics
  - Updating issue status (Open → In Progress → Implemented → Delivered → Closed)
  - Synchronizing local `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` with GitHub Issues

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Sprint** | Time-boxed iteration (typically 1-3 weeks) with selected user-stories from not-started queue |
| **current-sprint.md** | Active sprint planning document; archived as sprint-[N].md after closure |
| **project-status.md** | Live dashboard tracking epic progress, metrics, blockers, team assignments |
| **<US-REF>.md** | User story file with story definition + enrichment sections (AC, BDD scenarios, UX inputs, API contracts) |
| **Epic** | Organizational grouping of related user-stories (e.g., "User Authentication") |
| **User-Story** | Granular unit of work implementing specific user value (e.g., "US-001: User can login with email") |
| **Implementation-Plan** | Layer-by-layer technical decomposition created by Dev-Lead, guides TDD-Orchestrator |
| **BDD Scenario** | Gherkin test case (Given-When-Then) that defines story acceptance criteria |
| **TDD Cycle** | RED (write failing test) → GREEN (implement to pass) → REFACTOR (improve while passing) |
| **Layer** | Architectural level: Database (L1) → Backend (L2) → Config (L3) → Frontend (L4) |
| **DOR (Definition of Ready)** | Story ready for dev entry: AC clear, BDD scenarios defined, UX inputs present, no blockers |
| **DOD (Definition of Done)** | Story complete: BDD passing, >80% coverage, code review approved, BA validation passed |
| **Status Flow** | Not Started → In Progress → Implemented → Delivered (→ Epic closure when all stories done) |

---0: PM INITIALIZES GITHUB INTEGRATION

**Goal**: Create GitHub issues for all user stories and establish synchronization between local tracking and remote issue tracker

**Activities**:
1. **Verify GitHub Repository Access**:
   - Confirm repository exists and agent has write access
   - Verify permissions to create issues, labels, and milestones
   - Validate repository structure matches project requirements

2. **Create Tracking Document**:
   - Create `/docs/user-stories/usor "In Progress" user-story that needs implementation
   - Verify GitHub issue number exists for this story

2. **Validate Prerequisites Exist**:
   - ✅ GitHub Issue exists and is accessible
   - ✅ `/docs/user-stories/<USER-STORY-REF>/implementation-plan.md` exists and is complete
   - ✅ `features/<domain>/<story-ref>.feature` file exists with BDD scenarios
   - ✅ `features/<domain>/<story-ref>.steps.ts` exists with failing test definitions
   - ✅ BDD tests have been run and documented as failing

   - Request Lead Dev complete Phase 2: "Create implementation-plan.md and BDD tests for story <USER-STORY-REF>"
   - Update GitHub Issue: Add comment "⚠️ Blocked: Missing implementation-plan.md and BDD tests"

4. **If Prerequisites Complete**:
   - Proceed to Phase 3: Launch TDD-Orchestrator with implementation-plan.md
   - Verify GitHub Issue status is "In Progress"

**Input**: `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` with GitHub issue numbers, status from `/docs/user-stories/<USER-STORY-REF>/`, GitHub Issue API  
**Output**: Validation report, blocker detection with GitHub issue link, handoff to Phase 2 (if needed) or Phase 3 (if ready)  
**Outcome**: Ensure TDD execution starts with complete technical specification and GitHub tracking

5. **Setup PM Dashboard**:

   - Track counts: Total stories, Not Started, In Progress, Implemented, Delivered
   - Monitor velocity: Stories completed per sprint
   - Identify blockers: Stories stuck in same status >2 days

6. **Commit and Handoff**:
   - Commit `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` and GitHub Issue number (e.g., #123)
   - Review `/docs/prd/user-stories.md` for story details and BDD scenarios
   - Review GitHub Issue for acceptance criteria and any stakeholder comments

2. **Update GitHub Issue Status**:
   - Change GitHub Issue status from "Not Started" to "In Progress"
   - Add comment: "🚀 Starting implementation planning. Creating layer decomposition and BDD tests."
   - Update `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md`: Mark status "In Progress" (synchronized with GitHub)
**PM Continuous Monitoring**:
- **Daily**: Check `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` for status changes
- **Weekly**: Report to stakeholders: Stories delivered, stories in progress, projected completion
- **Per Sprint**: Calculate velocity, adjust sprint planning based on team capacity

   - ✅ `features/<domain>/<story-ref>.feature` file exists with BDD scenarios
   - ✅ `features/<domain>/<story-ref>.steps.ts` exists with failing test definitions
   - ✅ BDD tests have been run and documented as failing

3. **If Prerequisites Missing**:
   - 🛑 **PAUSE workflow**
   - Present blocker to user: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> is missing required artifacts"
   - Request Lead Dev complete Phase 2: "Create implementation-plan.md and BDD tests for story <USER-STORY-REF>"

4. **If Prerequisites Complete**:
   - Proceed to Phase 3: Launch TDD-Orchestrator with implementation-plan.md

**Input**: `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md`, status from `/docs/user-stories/<USER-STORY-REF>/`  
**Output**: Validation report, blocker detection, handoff to Phase 2 (if needed) or Phase 3 (if ready)  
**Outcome**: Ensure TDD execution starts with complete technical specification

   - Add comment to GitHub Issue:
     - "✅ Implementation plan complete: `/docs/user-stories/<USER-STORY-REF>/implementation-plan.md`"
     - "✅ BDD tests created and failing (expected): `features/<domain>/<story-ref>.feature`"
     - Link to commit with implementation-plan.md and BDD tests
   - Commit all artifacts to repository (implementation-plan.md, feature files, step definitions)
   - Verify `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` status is "In Progress" (already set in step 2)
   - Hand off to Orchestrator with:

     - **Layer 4 (Frontend)**:
       - Components to create (hierarchy)
       - State management (reducer, context, etc.)
       - API client integration
       - Styling (design tokens from `/docs/design/design-systems.md`)
       - Responsive design requirements
       - BDD assertions this layer enables
       - TDD approach: Component tests → implement components
       - Files to create: List specific component, style, service files
   - Include architectural constraints from `/docs/prd/architecture-design.md`
   - Include design requirements from `/docs/prd/design-systems.md`
   - Define "Definition of Done": All BDD scenarios pass, test coverage > 80%, code review approved

4. **Extract & Integrate BDD Scenarios**:
   - Extract Gherkin scenarios from `/docs/prd/user-stories.md`
   - Create feature file: `features/<domain>/<story-ref>.feature`
   - Create step definition file: `features/<domain>/<story-ref>.steps.ts`
   - Write step definitions that call actual endpoints/components
   - Run BDD tests → They FAIL (expected - layers not implemented)

5. **Update Status & Hand Off**:
   - Update `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md`: Mark story "In Progress"
   - Hand off to Orchestrator with:
     - GitHub Issue link
     - Implementation-plan.md path (complete and detailed)
     - BDD feature file path
     - BDD test execution results (failing)
     - Message: "User-story ready for TDD execution. implementation-plan.md complete, BDD tests failing."

**Input**: User-story reference from Orchestrator blocker, `/docs/prd/user-stories.md` (PRD reference), `/docs/prd/architecture-design.md`, `/docs/prd/tech-spec.md`, `/docs/design/design-systems.md`  
**Output**: GitHub Issue, implementation-plan.md (complete), BDD feature files with failing tests, `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` updated to "In Progress"  
**Outcome**: Clear, detailed technical roadmap (implementation-plan.md) and failing BDD tests ready for TDD execution

   - Retrieve GitHub Issue number for tracking

2. **Present TDD Execution Options**:
   - Option 1: Fast-track (minimal refactoring, focus on passing tests)
   - Option 2: Balanced (pass tests + basic refactoring per layer)
   - Option 3: Quality-first (pass tests + comprehensive refactoring + documentation)
   - User selects approach

3. **Update GitHub Issue**:
   - Add comment: "⚙️ Starting TDD execution. Approach: <selected-approach>. Will implement 4 layers: DB → Backend → Config → Frontend."

4. **Launch TDD-Orchestrator**:

**Input**: Handoff from Lead Dev with complete implementation-plan.md and failing BDD tests  
**Output**: TDD-Orchestrator engagement decision, selected execution approach  
**Outcome**: Clear handoff to TDD execution with technical specification locked

PHASE 4: TDD-ORCHESTRATOR EXECUTION (DRIVEN BY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN)

**Goal**: Implement all 4 layers using disciplined TDD cycles, guided by implementation-plan and driven by failing BDD tests. **Implementation IS simply applying TDD to the implementation-plan specification.**

**🔴 CRITICAL VALIDATION BEFORE STARTING**:
- Verify <USER-STORY-REF> matches EXACTLY in:
  - implementation-plan.md file path: `/docs/user-stories/<EXACT-US-REF>/implementation-plan.md`
  - implementation-plan.md header section
  - /docs/user-stories/user-stories.md
  - /docs/prd/user-stories.md (source of truth)
  - GitHub Issue title (should include [US-XXX])
- If ANY divergence found: STOP immediately and escalate to PM/Lead Dev to correct before proceeding
- Do NOT proceed with implementation if numbering is inconsistent

**Flow**:
```
TDD-Orchestrator reads: /docs/user-stories/<USER-STORY-REF>/implementation-plan.md

FOR each layer (Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3 → Layer 4):
  READ: implementation-plan.md section for this layer
    └─ Note: Files to create, TDD approach, architectural constraints, BDD assertions for this layer
  
  RED PHASE: Write failing test code
    └─ Use TDD-RED Agent to write test code per implementation-plan.md
    └─ Tests verify file creation, structure, and BDD assertion support
    └─ Tests should FAIL (implementation doesn't exist yet)
  
  GREEN PHASE: Implement minimum code to pass tests
    └─ Use TDD-GREEN Agent to write production code per implementation-plan.md
    └─ Follow file list and structure in implementation-plan.md exactly
    └─ Implement just enough to make RED tests pass
    └─ Verify: BDD assertions for this layer now pass
  
  REFACTOR PHASE: Improve code quality while keeping tests passing
    └─ Use TDD-REFACTOR Agent to clean code per implementation-plan.md constraints
    └─ Apply SOLID principles, remove duplication, clarify structure
    └─ Verify: All tests still pass, code quality improved

  COMMIT: Layer complete, tests passing, code reviewed

AFTER ALL LAYERS:
  RUN: Full BDD test suite for entire story → ALL passing
  UPDATE: /docs/user-stories/user-stories.md → Mark "Implemented"
  HAND OFF: Return to Orchestrator "Story complete. All BDD tests passing. Ready for next story."
```

**Layer-Specific TDD Details**:

**Layer 1: Database**
- No TDD cycle (no unit tests needed)
- TDD-GREEN directly writes Liquibase/SQL migration scripts
- Verify: Migration runs, schema created, models can interact with DB
- BDD assertions enabled: Data persistence, schema validation
- No unit tests to refactor

**Layer 2: Backend**
- **TDD-RED**: Write controller tests (mock service calls), then service tests (mock repository calls)
- **TDD-GREEN**: Implement controllers → services → repositories to make tests pass
- **TDD-REFACTOR**: Improve separation of concerns, reduce duplication
- BDD assertions enabled: API endpoints, business logic, data validation

**Output During Execution**:
- **After Each Layer**: Add comment to GitHub Issue:
  - "✅ Layer N complete: <layer-name>. Tests passing. BDD assertions enabled: <list>."
  - Commit code with message referencing issue (e.g., "feat(US-001): Implement database layer #123")
- **After Layer 4**: All implementation code committed to repository

**Input**: Implementation-plan.md (complete specification), failing BDD tests, selected TDD approach, GitHub Issue number, architecture-design.md, test-strategies.md  
**Output**: Implemented and tested code for all 4 layers (following implementation-plan.md), all BDD tests passing, unit/integration tests per layer (>80% coverage), commits linked to GitHub Issue  
**Outcome**: User-story fully implemented per specification, BDD scenarios passing, ready for Dev-Lead status synchronization
GitHub Repository Access**: Project MUST be on GitHub with write access. No GitHub = workflow cannot proceed.
2. **Implementation-Plan Quality**: The more detailed the plan (layer breakdown, files to create, BDD assertions per layer), the faster TDD-Orchestrator executes
3. **Failing BDD Tests as Entry Point**: BDD tests are not validation at the end—they are the specification that drives implementation
4. **One Story at a Time**: Complete all phases (Prep → TDD → Sync → Validation) for one story before moving to next
5. **Synchronization Discipline**: Lead Dev MUST update both `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` AND GitHub Issue after each phase (In Progress → Implemented)
6. **BA Validation Gate**: No story moves to "Delivered" without BA validation. Bugs block progression.
7. **Status Tracking**: `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` is local source of truth, synchronized with GitHub Issues (remote source of truth)
8. **PM Monitoring**: PM continuously checks progress counts (Not Started, In Progress, Implemented, Delivered) to track team velocity
9. **Epic Tracking**: Stories are tagged with parent epic in GitHub; when all stories of an epic are "Delivered", epic is automatically "Delivered"
10. **Clear Layer Boundaries**: Each layer has specific scope (DB doesn't test code, Backend doesn't test UI), makes TDD cycles clean and fast

**Prereq0 → Phase 1 (PM → Orchestrator)**:
- [ ] GitHub repository access verified (write permissions)
- [ ] `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` created with all user-stories
- [ ] GitHub Issues created for ALL user-stories

0** | PM | `/docs/prd/user-stories.md`, GitHub credentials | GitHub Issues for all stories, `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` with issue numbers | 1-2 hours (one-time setup) |
| **PHASE 1** | Orchestrator | `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` with GitHub issue numbers | Validation report, blocker detection, handoff to Phase 2 or Phase 3 | 15-30 min |
| **PHASE 2** | Lead Dev | User-story reference, GitHub Issue #, PRD docs, architectural specs | implementation-plan.md, BDD tests, GitHub Issue updated to "In Progress" | 1-2 hours per story |
| **PHASE 3** | Orchestrator | Handoff from Lead Dev with complete plan, GitHub Issue # | TDD execution launch, selected approach, GitHub Issue updated | 15-30 min |
| **PHASE 4** | TDD-Orchestrator | implementation-plan.md, failing BDD tests, approach, GitHub Issue # | Implemented code, passing BDD tests, >80% coverage, commits linked to issue | 2-5 days per story |
| **PHASE 5** | Lead Dev | Handoff from TDD with BDD results, GitHub Issue # | `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` and GitHub Issue both "Implemented", handoff to BA | 15-30 min |
| **PHASE 6** | BA | User-story reference, GitHub Issue #, BDD feature files, running app | Validation report, `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` and GitHub Issue both "Delivered" (or bugs documented) | 1-3 hours per story |

**Iteration**: Repeat Phases 1-6 for each user-story in sprint until all selected stories are "Delivered"

**Epic Completion**: Automatic when ALL user-stories in an epic are marked "Delivered" (validated by BA)

**PM Continuous Monitoring**: PM checks `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` daily for progress (counts of Not Started, In Progress, Implemented, Delivered)

**Key Constraints**: 
- Phase 0 MUST complete first - no GitHub Issues = workflow cannot proceed
- Phase 4 (TDD execution) CANNOT begin until Phase 2 (implementation-plan.md creation) is complete
- Phase 6 (next story) CANNOT begin until current story is "Delivered" by BA validation
- Bugs found in Phase 6 block progression until fixed and re-validated

**Synchronization Points**:
- **Local**: `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` (committed to repository)
- **Remote**: GitHub Issues (status: Open → In Progress → Implemented → Delivered → Closed)
- **Lead Dev Responsibility**: Keep both synchronized after each phase
**Phase 6 → Phase 1 (BA → Orchestrator)**:
- **If Validation PASSES**:
  - [ ] BDD tests passing in browser (E2E validation complete)
  - [ ] Exploratory testing complete (all workflows validated)
  - [ ] Design system compliance verified
  - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
  - [ ] Validation report documented in GitHub Issue
  - [ ] Screenshots attached to GitHub Issue
  - [ ] `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` updated to "Delivered" and committed
  - [ ] GitHub Issue updated: Status changed to "Delivered"
  - [ ] Synchronization verified: local status == GitHub Issue status
  - [ ] Message: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) delivered. Validation complete. Ready for next story."
- **If Validation FAILS**:
  - [ ] Bugs documented in GitHub Issue with details (description, repro steps, severity)
  - [ ] Screenshots/logs attached to GitHub Issue
  - [ ] "Bug" label added to GitHub Issue
  - [ ] Status remains "Implemented" (NOT "Delivered")
  - [ ] Message: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) validation failed. Bugs documented. Please fix and notify for re-validation."
  - [ ] **Workflow pauses** - do NOT proceed to next story until bugs fixed
     - BDD feature file path for validation
     - List of implemented features/endpoints
     - Message: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) implemented. All BDD tests passing. Ready for validation testing."

**Input**: Handoff from TDD-Orchestrator with BDD test results and commits, `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md`, GitHub Issue number  
**Output**: `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` updated to "Implemented" (committed), GitHub Issue updated with completion details and "Implemented" status, handoff to BA  
**Outcome**: Complete synchronization between local tracking and GitHub, clear handoff to BA for validation

**Lead Dev Responsibilities Summary**:
- **After each iteration** (Phase 4 completion): Update status to "Implemented"
- **After each user-story** implemented: Synchronize local and GitHub tracking
- **Continuous**: Monitor GitHub Issues for comments, blockers, or status changes from BA

---

### PHASE 6: BA VALIDATES FEATURE (DELIVERED)

**Goal**: Execute comprehensive validation testing using Playwright E2E tests to confirm feature meets acceptance criteria, then mark as "Delivered"

**Prerequisites**: Phase 5 complete with user-story status "Implemented" and all BDD tests passing

**Activities**:
1. **Receive Handoff from Lead Dev**:
   - User-story reference (e.g., US-001)
   - GitHub Issue number and link
   - BDD feature file path: `features/<domain>/<story-ref>.feature`
   - List of implemented features/endpoints
   - Review GitHub Issue acceptance criteria

2. **Setup Validation Environment**:
   - Ensure application is running (local dev server or staging environment)
   - Install Playwright browsers if needed: `mcp_microsoft_pla_browser_install`
   - Review BDD scenarios to understand expected behavior

3. **Execute BDD Tests in Browser (E2E Validation)**:
   - Run BDD tests via Playwright: Execute Gherkin scenarios with browser automation
   - Capture: Screenshots on failure, console logs, network requests
   - Validate: All Given-When-Then steps execute correctly in real browser

4. **Perform Exploratory Testing**:
   - Test user workflows end-to-end (beyond BDD scenarios)
   - Verify edge cases: Empty states, validation errors, boundary conditions
   - Test error handling: Invalid inputs, network failures, timeouts
   - Cross-browser testing (if required): Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Mobile responsiveness (if required)

5. **Validate Design System Compliance**:
   - Review `/docs/design/design-systems.md` for design tokens and components
   - Verify: Colors, typography, spacing, component styling match design system
   - Take screenshots for visual regression (optional)

6. **Validate Against Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Cross-reference GitHub Issue acceptance criteria with implemented feature
   - Ensure all criteria are met (checked off in issue comments)

7. **Document Test Results**:
   - Create validation report:
     - BDD test results: X/X scenarios passing
     - Exploratory test findings: Pass/Fail per workflow
     - Design system compliance: Pass/Fail
     - Acceptance criteria checklist: All ✅
     - Screenshots: Key workflows (attach to GitHub Issue)
     - Browser/device coverage: Tested on X browsers

8. **If Validation FAILS**:
   - Document bugs in GitHub Issue:
     - Comment: "❌ Validation failed. Bugs found:"
     - List bugs with: Description, Steps to reproduce, Expected vs Actual, Severity
     - Attach: Screenshots, console logs, network traces
   - Add "Bug" label to GitHub Issue
   - Keep status "Implemented" (not "Delivered")
   - Hand back to Lead Dev: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) validation failed. Bugs documented in issue. Please address and notify when ready for re-validation."
   - **Do NOT proceed to next user-story until bugs are fixed**

9. **If Validation PASSES**:
   - Update `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md`: Change status from "Implemented" to "Delivered"
   - Commit user-stories.md with message: "chore: Mark US-<REF> as Delivered after BA validation #<ISSUE-NUM>"
   - Update GitHub Issue:
     - Change status to "Delivered" (or add "Delivered" label)
     - Add comment: "✅ Validation complete. All tests passing."
     - Attach validation report (test results, screenshots, coverage)
     - Close issue or move to "Done" column (per project workflow)
   - Hand off to Orchestrator: "User-story <USER-STORY-REF> (Issue #<ISSUE-NUM>) delivered. Validation complete. Ready for next story."

**Input**: Handoff from Lead Dev with user-story reference and GitHub Issue link, BDD feature files, running application  
**Output**: Validation report, `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` updated to "Delivered" (or bugs documented), GitHub Issue updated to "Delivered" (or "Bug" label added)  
**Outcome**: Feature validated and delivered (or bugs returned to Dev for fixing), clear gate before moving to next user-story

**BA Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] BDD tests passing in browser (E2E validation)
- [ ] Exploratory testing complete for all workflows
- [ ] Edge cases and error handling validated
- [ ] Design system compliance verified

- **TDD-GREEN**: Create components, wire API calls, apply design system styling
- **TDD-REFACTOR**: Simplify component logic, extract subcomponents
- BDD assertions enabled: UI rendering, user interactions, data display

**Input**: Implementation-plan.md (complete specification), failing BDD tests, selected TDD approach, architecture-design.md, test-strategies.md  
**Output**: Implemented and tested code for all 4 layers (following implementation-plan.md), all BDD tests passing, unit/integration tests per layer (>80% coverage), `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` updated to "Implemented"  
**Outcome**: User-story fully implemented per specification, BDD scenarios passing, ready for next story iteration

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **🔴 NUMBERING CONSISTENCY (MOST CRITICAL)**: All references to user-stories MUST use exact <USER-STORY-REF> from `/docs/prd/user-stories.md`. No abbreviations, typos, or renumbering schemes allowed. Any divergence breaks orchestration workflow.
   - Validate at EVERY phase handoff
   - Source of truth: `/docs/prd/user-stories.md`
   - Check: current-sprint.md, implementation-plan.md paths, GitHub Issue titles, /docs/user-stories/user-stories.md
   - Pause workflow immediately if ANY inconsistency found
2. **Implementation-Plan Quality**: The more detailed the plan (layer breakdown, files to create, BDD assertions per layer), the faster TDD-Orchestrator executes
3. **Failing BDD Tests as Entry Point**: BDD tests are not validation at the end—they are the specification that drives implementation
4. **One Story at a Time**: Complete all 4 layers for one story before moving to next, ensures focused work and clean git history
5. **Clear Layer Boundaries**: Each layer has specific scope (DB doesn't test code, Backend doesn't test UI), makes TDD cycles clean and fast
6. **Status Tracking**: `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` is the orchestrator's source of truth for what to do next
7. **Epic Tracking**: Stories are tagged with parent epic; when all stories of an epic are "Implemented", epic is automatically "Implemented"

---

## Summary Table

| Phase | Agent | Input | Output | Duration |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| **PHASE 1** | PM | `/docs/prd/user-stories.md` (source of truth for US-REF), `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` | Validation: current-sprint.md references MATCH `/docs/prd/user-stories.md` exactly (no typos), GitHub Issues created with exact US-REF | 15-30 min |
| **PHASE 2** | BA | User-story (exact US-REF from PRD), current-sprint.md (validated references) | `/docs/user-stories/<EXACT-US-REF>/<US-REF>.md` enriched, numbering validated | 1-2 hours per story |
| **PHASE 3** | Dev-Lead | User-story (exact US-REF), enriched file, PRD/architecture/design docs | implementation-plan.md at `/docs/user-stories/<EXACT-US-REF>/implementation-plan.md`, BDD tests, numbering pre-validated | 1-2 hours per story |
| **PHASE 4** | TDD-Orchestrator | implementation-plan.md (numbering pre-validated), failing BDD tests, approach | Implemented code, passing BDD tests, >80% coverage, commits reference exact US-REF | 2-5 days per story |
| **PHASE 5** | Dev-Lead | Handoff from TDD with BDD results, exact US-REF | `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` "Implemented" (exact US-REF), GitHub Issue updated, handoff to BA | 15-30 min |
| **PHASE 6** | BA | User-story (exact US-REF), GitHub Issue, BDD files | `/docs/user-stories/user-stories.md` "Delivered" (exact US-REF), GitHub Issue closed | 1-3 hours per story |

**🔴 CRITICAL VALIDATION GATE**: Before every phase handoff, verify <USER-STORY-REF> matches EXACTLY with `/docs/prd/user-stories.md`. Any divergence blocks progression.

**Iteration**: Repeat Phases 1-6 for each user-story in sprint until all selected stories are "Delivered"

**Epic Completion**: Automatic when ALL user-stories in an epic are marked "Delivered"

**Key Constraints**: 
- Phase 4 (TDD execution) CANNOT begin until Phase 3 (implementation-plan.md creation) is complete
- **NUMBERING CONSISTENCY IS CRITICAL**: All <USER-STORY-REF> must match exactly with `/docs/prd/user-stories.md`
- **Validation Gate**: Before every phase handoff, verify 1:1 match between current-sprint.md, implementation-plan.md paths, GitHub Issue titles, and `/docs/prd/user-stories.md`
