## How to Refine This Prompt

When documentation output needs improvement:

1. **Identify the issue**: What was missing or unclear?
2. **Update the prompt**: Add specific guidance in the relevant section
3. **Re-generate**: Use updated prompt with the same parameters
4. **Compare quality**: Does the new version address the issue?
5. **Document**: Note what change improved output

### Common Refinements

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Too technical for end-users | Add: "Use everyday language. Avoid terms like API, database, microservices without explaining" |
| Missing examples | Add: "Include at least 5 realistic examples with actual values" |
| Vague requirements | Add: "All requirements must have numbered acceptance criteria" |
| Poor organization | Add: "Reorder sections: Overview → Requirements → Implementation → Testing" |
| No diagrams | Add: "Include Mermaid diagram for every workflow/architecture section" |
