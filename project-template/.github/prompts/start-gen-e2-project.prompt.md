## Objective
Initialize a new AI-first delivery project by gathering comprehensive requirements, creating structured project architecture, and establishing complete development framework with documentation, infrastructure, and deployment pipelines.

## Context
You are setting up a greenfield AI-first delivery project that requires complete project initialization including infrastructure setup, comprehensive documentation, development workflows, and CI/CD pipelines. This process involves stakeholder consultation and systematic project scaffolding following AI-first delivery methodology.

## Requirements

### Pre-Implementation Consultation
Conduct structured stakeholder interview to gather essential project information:

1. **Project Requirements & Features**:
   - What are the core project requirements and key features?
   - Are there specific compliance, security, or regulatory requirements?
   - What business problem does this project solve?
   - What are the success criteria and key performance indicators?

2. **Infrastructure & Architecture**:
   - Which cloud provider will be used (AWS/Azure/GCP/On-premises)?
   - What is the target architecture pattern (microservices/monolith/serverless)?
   - Infrastructure as Code preference (Terraform/CloudFormation/CDK)?
   - Scalability and performance requirements?

3. **Legacy System Considerations**:
   - Is this a legacy application replatforming project?
   - Are there existing systems requiring integration or data migration?
   - What migration constraints and timeline exist?

4. **Technical Stack Decisions**:
   - API-first or frontend-first development approach?
   - API architecture preference (RESTful/GraphQL/gRPC)?
   - Required programming languages and frameworks?
   - Database and data storage strategy?

### Project Architecture Foundation
Establish comprehensive project structure based on requirements:
## Deliverables

### 1. Comprehensive Project Structure

```

### 2. Core Documentation Suite
- **README.md**: Project description, setup instructions, development workflow
- **docs/index.md**: Master documentation index with navigation
- **docs/CONTRIBUTE.md**: Development guidelines, coding standards, contribution process
- **docs/project-overview/**: Business context, requirements, success criteria
- **docs/features/**: Individual feature documentation (one file per feature)

### 3. Technical Specifications
- **API Documentation**: `backend/docs/apidoc.yaml` (OpenAPI/Swagger specification)
- **Infrastructure Architecture**: PlantUML diagrams in `infra/docs/`
- **Database Schema**: Data model documentation and migration scripts
- **Security Documentation**: Authentication, authorization, and security best practices

### 4. Development Environment Setup
- **Language-Specific Files**: Package.json, requirements.txt, or equivalent dependency files
- **Environment Configuration**: .env templates, configuration management
- **Version Control**: .gitignore, .gitattributes, initial Git repository setup
- **Code Quality Tools**: Linters, formatters, pre-commit hooks configuration

### 5. Infrastructure and Deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/CloudFormation files in `infra/` directory
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI configurations in `DevOps/pipeline/`
- **Environment Management**: Staging and production environment configurations
- **Monitoring Setup**: Logging, metrics, and alerting infrastructure
