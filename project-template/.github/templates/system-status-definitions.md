# System Status Definitions

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for workflow states and approval statuses across all templates.  
**Usage**: Reference these definitions in all template metadata and status fields.

---

## Workflow States (5-State Model)

Used to track the progression of work items (stories, tasks, features) through the development lifecycle.

### State Diagram
```
⬜ NOT_STARTED → 🟨 IN_PROGRESS → 🟠 IN_REVIEW → ✅ IMPLEMENTED → 📦 DELIVERED
                     ↓
              (can return to)
              NOT_STARTED if blocked
```

### State Definitions

## Approval Statuses (For Review Gates)

Used in approval-gate.template.md, code-review-checklist.template.md, and similar review workflows.

### Approval State Diagram
```
⏳ PENDING → 🟨 REVIEWING → ✅ APPROVED → 🎯 CONDITIONAL → 📋 IMPLEMENTATION

## Status Field Usage by Template

### In YAML Templates

```yaml
# user-story.template.yml
basic_info:
  status: "not_started"  # Use ID: 1-not_started, 2-in_progress, etc.
  status_readable: "Not Started"
  status_emoji: "⬜"

# epic.template.yml
details:
  status: "in_progress"

# approval-gate.template.md
approvals:
  gate_status: "pending"  # ID from approval section
  gate_status_emoji: "⏳"
```

### In Markdown Templates

```markdown
# User Story: US-001

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | ⬜ Not Started |
| Workflow State | not_started |
| Last Updated | 2026-03-16 |

# Approval Gate: CODE_REVIEW_001

| Approval Status | Reviewer | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Code Review | Alice | ✅ Approved |
| Security Review | Bob | 🟨 Reviewing |
| **Overall Gate** | **—** | **🟨 Reviewing** |
```

## Status Transitions & Rules

### Valid Workflow Transitions
```yaml
state_transitions:
  not_started:
    allowed_to: [in_progress]
    
  in_progress:
    allowed_to: [in_review, not_started]
    
  in_review:
    allowed_to: [implemented, in_progress]
    
  implemented:
    allowed_to: [delivered]
    
  delivered:
    allowed_to: []  # Terminal state

approval_transitions:
  pending:
    allowed_to: [reviewing, approved]
    
  reviewing:
    allowed_to: [approved, rejected, conditional]
    
  approved:
    allowed_to: []  # Terminal state
    
  conditional:
    allowed_to: [approved, rejected]
    
  rejected:
    allowed_to: [remediation]
    
  remediation:
    allowed_to: [pending, rejected]
```

### Transition Rules
- ✅ Forward progression only (mostly)
- ✅ Backward only if work found to be inadequate/blocked
- ✅ Always document "why" when transitioning backward
- ✅ Update timestamp on every transition
- ✅ Log transitions in append-only audit trail (tdd-execution.md, etc.)

## Implementation Checklist

When adding status to a new template:

- [ ] Choose status from this document (don't invent new ones)
- [ ] Use `status_id` (e.g., `not_started`) in code/YAML
- [ ] Use `status_emoji` (e.g., ⬜) for visible/readable output
- [ ] Use `status_readable` (e.g., "Not Started") for display
- [ ] Include `status_changed_date` or `last_updated` timestamp
- [ ] Document transition reason (especially for backward transitions)
- [ ] Reference this file in template documentation
- [ ] Ensure transitions follow rules above
