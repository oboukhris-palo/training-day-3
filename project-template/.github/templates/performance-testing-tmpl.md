## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Baseline Performance (Normal Load)

**Purpose**: Establish baseline metrics with typical user behavior

**Load Profile**:
- Load: 100 concurrent users
- Ramp-up: 2 minutes (5 users/sec)
- Duration: 10 minutes (steady state)
- Think time: 2-5 seconds between requests

**Endpoints to Test**:
```
1. POST /api/v1/{feature}/action        (Create/Update - 30% of traffic)
   Payload: ~2KB typical request

2. GET /api/v1/{feature}/{id}           (Retrieve - 50% of traffic)
   Payload: ~5KB typical response

3. DELETE /api/v1/{feature}/{id}        (Delete - 10% of traffic)
   Payload: ~100B typical request

4. GET /api/v1/{feature}?filter=value   (List - 10% of traffic)
   Payload: ~50KB typical response (paginated)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✓ Response time (p95) <{X}ms
- ✓ Error rate <0.1%
- ✓ CPU <70%
- ✓ Memory <75%

**Baseline Metrics** (to be populated after test):
```
Response Time (p50): _____ ms
Response Time (p95): _____ ms
Response Time (p99): _____ ms
Error Rate: _____ %
Throughput: _____ req/s
CPU Peak: _____ %
Memory Peak: _____ %
```

---

### Test 2: Peak Load (2x Normal)

**Purpose**: Validate performance under peak expected load

**Load Profile**:
- Load: 300 concurrent users (2x baseline)
- Ramp-up: 5 minutes (10 users/sec)
- Duration: 15 minutes (steady state)
- Think time: 2-5 seconds

**Success Criteria**:
- ✓ Response time (p95) <{X}ms (acceptable: up to 1.5x baseline)
- ✓ Error rate <0.5%
- ✓ CPU <80%
- ✓ Memory <85%
- ✓ Database pool <90%

**Peak Load Metrics** (to be populated after test):
```
Response Time (p95): _____ ms (+__% vs baseline)
Error Rate: _____ % (+__% vs baseline)
CPU Peak: _____ %
Memory Peak: _____ %
DB Connections Peak: _____ / {total}
```

---

### Test 3: Stress Test (5x Normal)

**Purpose**: Identify breaking points and system limits

**Load Profile**:
- Load: 500+ concurrent users (5x baseline)
- Ramp-up: 10 minutes (continuous ramp)
- Duration: Until system reaches critical threshold or recovers
- Think time: 0-2 seconds (aggressive)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Queue formation (acceptable): Requests queue, respond after waiting
- Graceful degradation (acceptable): Error rate rises but <5%
- Circuit breaker opens (acceptable): Non-critical paths fail fast

**Unacceptable Behavior**:
- ✗ System crash or hang
- ✗ Data corruption or loss
- ✗ Cascading failures (external services affected)

**Stress Test Results** (to be populated after test):
```
Breaking Point (concurrent users): _____
Breaking Point (requests/sec): _____
Response at breaking point: _____ ms
Error rate at breaking point: _____ %
Recovery time after stress removed: _____ minutes
```

---

### Test 4: Endurance Test (Extended Duration)

**Purpose**: Detect memory leaks and long-running stability issues

**Load Profile**:
- Load: 150 concurrent users (1.5x baseline)
- Duration: 4 hours (half business day)
- Think time: 2-5 seconds
- Monitoring interval: Every 30 minutes

**Metrics Tracked**:
```
Time    | Avg Response | Memory (MB) | GC Count | Errors
--------|--------------|-------------|----------|--------
00:00   | 125ms        | 512MB       | 0        | 0
00:30   | 128ms        | 518MB       | 12       | 0
01:00   | 132ms        | 525MB       | 24       | 0
01:30   | 140ms        | 535MB       | 38       | 2
...     | ...          | ...         | ...      | ...
04:00   | 185ms        | 612MB       | 156      | 45
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✓ Memory grows <10% over 4 hours (no leak)
- ✓ Response time degradation <20%
- ✓ Error rate <0.2% (cumulative)
- ✓ GC pauses <100ms each

---

### Test 5: Failure Scenario (Dependency Failure)

**Purpose**: Validate graceful degradation when dependencies fail

#### Scenario A: Database Timeout

**Setup**:
- Normal load: 150 concurrent users
- At 5 minutes: Introduce 5 second database query delay
- Duration: 2 minutes
- At 7 minutes: Remove delay, restore normal DB

**Expected Behavior**:
- Connection pool saturates
- Requests timeout after {X} seconds
- Circuit breaker opens
- Error rate spikes to <5%
- After recovery: System returns to baseline

**Rollback Criteria**:
- If error rate exceeds 10%, stop test
- If system doesn't recover within 5 min, stop test

#### Scenario B: Cache Unavailable

**Setup**:
- Normal load: 150 concurrent users
- At 5 minutes: Stop cache service
- Duration: 5 minutes
- At 10 minutes: Restart cache

**Expected Behavior**:
- Request latency increases 5-10x (database bypass)
- Error rate remains <1% (fallback to DB)
- System remains functional
- After recovery: Cache repopulates gradually

---

### Test 6: Data Volume Scaling

**Purpose**: Test performance with large datasets

**Scenarios**:

| Scenario | Data Volume | Expected Impact | Acceptable |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Small | 100K records | Response: {X}ms | <{Y}ms |
| Medium | 1M records | Response: {X}ms | <{Y}ms |
| Large | 10M records | Response: {X}ms | <{Y}ms |

**Pagination Performance**:
```bash
# Test list endpoint with various page sizes
GET /api/v1/{feature}?page=1&size=10        # Response: {X}ms
GET /api/v1/{feature}?page=1&size=100       # Response: {X}ms
GET /api/v1/{feature}?page=100&size=1000    # Response: {X}ms
```

**Index Performance**:
- Verify database indexes used for all queries
- No full table scans on large datasets
- Query time remains <{X}ms for p95

## Performance Tuning Recommendations

### If Tests Fail

**Priority 1: Critical Path (p95 >SLA)**

```
Potential Issues:
  [ ] Unoptimized database queries
  [ ] Missing indexes
  [ ] Inefficient caching strategy
  [ ] Blocking operations
  
Remediation:
  1. Profile application with APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
  2. Identify top 5 slow queries (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
  3. Add missing indexes or refactor queries
  4. Re-run tests to validate improvement
```

**Priority 2: High Error Rate**

```
Potential Issues:
  [ ] Resource exhaustion (connections, memory)
  [ ] Invalid input handling
  [ ] Timeout configuration too aggressive
  
Remediation:
  1. Increase resource pools (connection pool, thread pool)
  2. Review error logs for error patterns
  3. Adjust timeout values
  4. Re-run tests
```

**Priority 3: Memory/CPU Spike**

```
Potential Issues:
  [ ] Memory leak in service
  [ ] Inefficient algorithms
  [ ] GC pauses
  
Remediation:
  1. Profile with memory profiler (JProfiler, YourKit)
  2. Check for unbounded caches or collections
  3. Review GC configuration
  4. Optimize hot code paths
  5. Re-run tests
```
