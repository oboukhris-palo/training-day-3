usage_notes: |
  ## How to Use This Document
  
  ### For Orchestrator Agent:
  1. **Read this document first** when assessing project status
  2. **Identify incomplete stories** (Not Started, In Progress, In Review)  
  3. **Check epic completion** (% stories Implemented per epic)
  4. **Determine next story** to tackle based on priorities and dependencies
  5. **Update statuses** as stories progress through implementation phases
  
  ### For Development Agents:
  1. **Update layer progress** as TDD cycles complete
  2. **Update BDD test status** after each layer
  3. **Report blockers** immediately with severity and ownership
  4. **Mark stories "In Review"** when all layers complete
  5. **Mark stories "Implemented"** after BDD validation and approval
  
  ### For Project Management:
  1. **Track sprint velocity** and adjust planning
  2. **Monitor blocker resolution** and escalate if needed
  3. **Plan next sprints** based on story readiness and team capacity
  4. **Report project progress** using completion percentages

synchronization_rules: |
  ## Synchronization with Issue Tracker
  
  This document should be synchronized with your issue tracking system:
  
  1. **GitHub Issues**: Each user story should have corresponding issue
  2. **Status Mapping**: 
     - Not Started → Issue: Open, no assignee
     - In Progress → Issue: Open, assigned, in development  
     - In Review → Issue: Open, assigned, ready for review
     - Implemented → Issue: Closed
  3. **Update Frequency**: Update this document when issue status changes
  4. **Automation**: Consider GitHub Actions to sync statuses automatically

maintenance: |
  ## Document Maintenance
  
  - **Update Frequency**: After each story status change, at minimum daily
  - **Owner**: Dev-Lead agent (primary), Orchestrator (coordination)
  - **Review Cycle**: Weekly review of metrics and next sprint planning
  - **Validation**: Cross-check with `/docs/prd/user-stories.md` for consistency
