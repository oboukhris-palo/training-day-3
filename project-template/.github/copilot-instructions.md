## 🚫 Documentation Rules (CRITICAL)

- **NEVER generate documentation unless explicitly requested by the user**
- **ONLY update README.md for all project documentation**
- **NEVER create additional documentation files** (e.g., AGENTS_REGISTRY.md, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, etc.)
- **ALWAYS ask permission before creating any new document**
- If documentation needs to be added, merge it into README.md instead

## 📋 General Guidelines

- For documentation standards please follow strictly /.github/instructions/documentation.instructions.md
- For code style guidelines please follow strictly /.github/instructions/coding.instructions.md
- For all knowledge about the product please refer to the PRD documents at /docs/prd/
- For a project from scratch, scan code base repository and follow strictly the same workflow as existing code: execute /.github/workflows/documents.workflows.md
- For a project with existing code, scan code base repository and follow strictly the same workflow, as you execute /.github/workflows/documents.workflows.md


## 🎯 Development Approach

- Always go interactively step by step to avoid mistakes, asking for clarifications when needed
- The programming language will be determined later for the project depending on the application requirements
- Help refine this project instructions file, rules, workflows and prompts as needed
- When trying to make an important choice for the project such as architecture, frameworks, libraries, database, or any other technology, always provide 3 options to choose from with pros and cons for each option
- Regardless of the technology stack, always follow best practices for code structure, design patterns, security, performance, and scalability
- Regardless of the document type if it's too long, break it into multiple parts and ask for confirmation after each part before proceeding
